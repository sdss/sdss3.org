<var>ugriz</var> magnitudes?</H3>

<p>First, note that all SDSS images (&quot;corrected frames&quot;,
<code>fpC*.fit</code> files) have a "soft bias" of 1000 data numbers
(DN) added so they can be stored as unsigned integer. Secondly, since DR1,
the sky has not been subtracted from the corrected frames, but is
stored in the header keyword <code>sky</code> in units of DN. The
<code>tsObj*.fit</code> and related tables and the CAS database store
sky values as surface brightness (maggies/sq. arcsec., where one
maggie corresponds to 0 magnitudes/sq. arcsec).</p>

<h4>Asinh and Pogson magnitudes</h4>

<p>All calibrated magnitudes in the <a
href="dr8/imaging/catalogs.php">photometric catalogs</a> are
given not as conventional <a
href="dr8/glossary/php#mag_pogson">Pogson</a> astronomical
magnitudes, but as <a href="dr8/algorithms/magnitudes.php#asinh">asinh
magnitudes</a>. We show how to obtain both kinds of magnitudes from
observed count rates from the SDSS images and vice versa.</p>

<p>See further down for <a
href="dr8/algorithms/fluxcal.php#SDSStoflux">conversion of SDSS magnitudes to physical fluxes</a>.
For both kinds of magnitudes, there are two ways to obtain the
zeropoint information for the conversion.</p>

<ol>

  <li><H4>A little slower, but gives the final calibration and works
      for all data releases</H4>

      <p>Here you first need the following information from the tsField
      files:</p>
         <pre>
               aa = zeropoint
               kk = extinction coefficient
        and    airmass
          </pre>

      <p>To get a calibrated magnitude, you first need to determine the
      extinction-corrected ratio of the observed count rate to the
      zero-point count rate:</p>
      <ul>
    <li>Convert the observed
        number of counts to a count rate using the exposure time <code>exptime
        = 53.907456 sec</code>,</li>

    <li>correct counts for atmospheric extinction using the
        extinction coefficient <code>kk</code> and the
        <code>airmass</code>, and </li>
    <li>divide by the zero-point count rate, which is given by
        <code>f<sub>0</sub> = 10<sup>-0.4*aa</sup></code> counts/second
        <strong>both for asinh and conventional
        magnitudes</strong>.</li>

      </ul>
      <dl>
    <dt>In a single step,</dt>
    <dd><code>f/f<sub>0</sub> = counts/exptime * 10<sup>0.4*(aa + kk *
        airmass)</sup></code>
     </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Then, calculate either the conventional ("Pogson") or the SDSS
      asinh magnitude from <code>f/f<sub>0</sub></code>:</p>
      <dl>
    <dt><strong>Pogson</strong></dt>
    <dd><code>mag = -2.5 * log10(f/f<sub>0</sub>)</code><br />

        <code>error(mag) = 2.5 / ln(10) * error(counts) /
        counts</code><br />
        To get the error on the counts, see the <a href="dr8/algorithms/fluxcal.php#counterr">note on computing count
        errors</a> below.</dd>
    <dt><strong>asinh</strong></dt>
    <dd><code>mag =
        -(2.5/ln(10))*[asinh((f/f<sub>0</sub>)/2b)+ln(b)]</code><br />

        <code>error(mag) = 2.5 / ln(10) * error(counts)/exptime *
        1/2b * <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10<sup>0.4*(aa + kk *
        airmass)</sup> / sqrt(1 + [(f/f<sub>0</sub>)/2b]<sup>2</sup>)</code>,<br />
        where <code>b</code> is the <em>softening parameter</em>
        for the photometric band in question and is given in the
        <a href="dr8/algorithms/fluxcal.php#asinh_table">table of b
        coefficients</a> below (for details on the asinh
        magnitudes, see the paper by <a

    <P><strong>Note</strong>: These values of the softening
    parameter <I>b</I> are set to be approximately 1-sigma of the sky
    noise; thus, only low signal-to-noise ratio measurements are affected
    by the difference between asinh and Pogson magnitudes. The final
    column gives the asinh magnitude associated with an object for which
    <I>f</I>/<I>f</I><SUB>0</SUB> = 10<I>b</I>; the difference between
    Pogson and asinh magnitudes is less than 1% for objects brighter than
    this.</p>


    <p>The calibrated asinh magnitudes are given in the <code>tsObj</code>
    files. To obtain counts from an asinh magnitude, you first need to
    work out <code>f/f<sub>0</sub></code> by inverting the asinh
    relation above. You can then determine the number of counts from
    <code>f/f<sub>0</sub></code> using the zero-point, extinction
    coefficient, airmass, and exposure time.</p>

      <p>The equations above are exact for DR1 and later
    releases. Strictly speaking, for EDR photometry, the corrected counts
    should include a color term <code>cc*(color-color0)*(X-X0)</code> (cf.
      equation 15 in section 4.5 in the EDR paper), but it turns out
      that generally, cc*(color-color0)*(X-X0) < 0.01 mag and the
      color term can be neglected. Hence the calibration looks
      identical for EDR and DR1.</p>
  </li>
  <li><H4>Faster magnitudes via "flux20"</H4>

      <p>The "flux20" keyword in the header of the corrected frames
      (fpC files) approximately gives the net number of
      counts for a 20th mag object.  So instead of using the zeropoint
      and airmass correction term from the <code>tsField</code> file,
      you can determine the corrected zero-point flux as</p>

      <dl>
    <dd><code>f/f<sub>0</sub> = counts/(10<sup>8</sup> * flux20)</code></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Then proceed with the calculation of a magnitude from
      <code>f/f<sub>0</sub></code> as above.</p>

      <p>The relation is only approximate because the final calibration
      information (provided by nfcalib) is not available at the
      time the corrected frames are generated.  We expect the error
      here (compared to the final calibrated magnitude) to be of order
      0.1 mag or so, as estimated from a couple of test cases we have
      tried out.</p>


      Note the counts measured by photo for each object are given
      in the fpObjc files, as e.g., "psfcounts", "petrocounts", etc.

  </li>
</ol>

<p>On a related note, <strong>in DR1</strong> one can also use relations
similar to the above to estimate the sky level in magnitudes per
sq. arcsec (1 pixel = 0.396 arcsec).  Either use the header keyword
"sky" in the fpC files, or remember to first subtract "softbias" (=
1000) from the raw background counts in the fpC files.  Note the sky
level is also given in the tsField files. <strong>This note only
applies to the DR1 and later data releases. Note also that the calibrated
sky brightnesses reported in the <code>tsField</code> values have been
corrected for atmospheric extinction</strong>.</p>


<h4 id="counterr">Computing errors on counts (converting counts to photo-electrons)</h4>

<p>The <code>fpC</code> (corrected frames) and <code>fpObjc</code>
(object tables with counts for each object instead of magnitudes)
files report counts (or &quot;data numbers&quot;, DN). However, it is
the number of photo-electrons which is really counted by the CCD
detectors and which therefore obeys Poisson statistics. The number of
photo-electrons is related to the number of counts through the gain
(which is really an inverse gain):</p>
<pre>
photo-electrons = counts * gain
</pre>
<p>The gain is reported in the headers of the <code>tsField</code> and
<code>fpAtlas</code> files (and hence also in the <code>field</code>
table in the CAS).  The total noise contributed by dark current and
read noise (in units of DN<sup>2</sup>) is also reported in the
<code>tsField</code> files in header keyword
<code>dark_variance</code> (and correspondingly as

<code>darkVariance</code> in the <code>field</code> table in the CAS),
and also as <code>dark_var</code> in the <code>fpAtlas</code>
header.</p>

<p>Thus, the error in DN is given by the following expression:</p>
<pre>
error(counts) = sqrt([counts+sky]/gain + Npix*(dark_variance+skyErr)),
</pre>
<p>where <code>counts</code> is the number of object counts,
<code>sky</code> is the number of sky counts <em>summed over the same
area as the object counts</em>, <code>Npix</code> is the area covered
by the object in pixels, <code>gain</code> and

<code>dark_variance</code> and <code>skyErr</code> are the gain, dark
variance, and the error on the estimate of the average sky level in
the frame, respectively, from the corresponding <code>tsField</code>
file.</p>
