<p>The <b>SPectroscopic IDentification of ERosita Sources
    (SPIDERS)</b> survey will take spectra of 50,000 X-ray emitting
    quasars and X-ray cluster galaxies detected by eROSITA, a
    ground-breaking new X-ray telescope to be launched in
    2014. Quasars emit copiously in X-rays, but some are obscured in
    visible light. This telescope combined with eBOSS follow-up will
    uncover this hidden population of obscured quasars. Because X-ray
    observations also allow robust measurements of black hole growth
    rates, eBOSS will provide the most complete measurements to date
    of the growth history of supermassive black holes. Meanwhile,
    SPIDERS observations of X-ray cluster galaxies will allow us to
    map the 3D distribution of these X-ray clusters â€” the most massive
    bound systems in the Universe, exceeding 10<sup>15</sup> times the
    mass of our Sun, and key tracers of the growth of structure. </p>

<p>The combination of SPIDERS with the <a
href="future/eboss.php">eBOSS</a> large-scale structure sample of
quasars, and the <a href="future/tdss.php">TDSS</a> variability
selected AGN sample, will create a unique window into the full
population of quasars at all epochs to redshift z = 3.</p>
