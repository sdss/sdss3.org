<h2> Survey Science Teams </h2>

<p> Each of the four surveys has its own Survey Science Team (SST), which
acts as the highest level of working group for science associated with
that survey. These SSTs are the analogue of the SDSS-I/II Working
Groups and correspond to the working groups described in the
PoO-III. The Director, in consultation with the survey PIs,
Spokesperson, and MC, will appoint a chairperson for each SST. The
chairperson will be someone other than the PI or the Survey
Scientist. Each SST will include all interested SDSS-III members
associated with each of the SDSS-III surveys. The SSTs should
communicate using the standard SDSS-III tools, including the survey
email lists, the survey wiki/webpages, telecons as needed, and
in-person meetings at SDSS-III Collaboration Meetings. The SSTs should
pay particular attention to integrating students, postdocs, and other
new members into the survey science programs and helping them
establish communications with colleagues in the Collaboration. The SST
Chair will report annually to the SDSS-III Spokesperson and CoCo on
the visibility, accessibility, and efficacy of the SST, including</p>

<ul>
<li> scientific participation of SDSS-III members (including approved external collaborators) in the survey science,</li>
<li> management of major projects that are central to the surveyâ€™s scientific objectives</li>
<li> management of survey data release and technical papers (see Publication Policy),</li>
<li> supervision of approved SST working groups,</li>
<li> promotion of the scientific output from the survey data.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Working Groups </h2>

<p> As described in the PoO-III and the Publication Policy, all
science projects using non-public SDSS-III data must be announced to
the Collaboration via the project-list web page when they are
initiated. At a level above these individual projects, which will
typically encompass one or several papers led by a few active team
members, scientists may wish to collaborate and coordinate in larger
groupings and thus create a "working group" (WG) for the sharing of
common knowledge, facilities and information. The scope of a WG will
typically encompass many complementary projects. To create a WG, a
brief statement (&lt; 1 page) should be submitted to the SST Chair and the
relevant SST email list(s) by the proposing group of SDSS-III
Participants. The statement should invite others to join to ensure a
critical mass of people (Participants and external collaborators) is
achieved. The SST Chair and Survey PI should then take input from all
members of the SST on whether the WG is required. If so, they will
mutually approve the WG and appoint a WG "convener" (in consultation
with the WG proposers) who is responsible for organizing the working
group activity and maintaining the WG activity and communications. The
WG convener may be asked to report to the SST Chair (and/or SDSS-III
Spokesperson) as the SST Chair is responsible for ensuring all WGs
remain active and relevant. All WGs should remain open to membership
from anyone within the SDSS-III collaboration. The PI and SST Chair
have the power to disband a WG by mutual agreement if the WG does not
remain active or appropriate. There is no requirement for any SST to
have WGs.</p>
