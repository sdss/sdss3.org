<p> We list here the four main collaboration policies used within the SDSS-III projects: </p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href="collaboration/imageuse.php">image use policy</a> describes how you can use SDSS
images. Non-commercial use is free with a link to sdss3.org and an image credit to the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Commercial use is usually available on request.</li>
<li>The <a href="collaboration/publication.php"> publication policy</a> that outlines
how SDSS-III publications are created and organized. This is an updated
version of the original SDSS-I/II policy.</li>
<li>The procedure for requesting <a href="collaboration/ext_collaborator.php"> external
collaborator status</a> as well as discussing other external participant
rules. These policies are essentially identical to the original SDSS-I/II
policies, but the language updated for the SDSS-III collaboration.</li>
<li>The policy on <a href="collaboration/working_groups.php"> survey science teams and
working groups</a> within the SDSS-III project.</li>
</ol>

<p>These documents were originally formulated and discussed within the
SDSS-III Collaboration Council (CoCo), which has a representative from
all the full and associate institutional partners. The CoCo is chaired
by the SDSS-III Spokesperson and these policies have been ratified by
the SDSS-III Advisory Council. See the <a href="collaboration/poo3.pdf"> SDSS-III
Principles of Operation </a> (PDF) document for more details on these
matters.</p>
