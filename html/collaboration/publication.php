<h2 id="intro">1. Introduction </h2>

<p>This document describes the policies and guidelines governing the
publication of scientific and technical results from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey III (hereafter SDSS-III). The SDSS-III Publication Policy
is designed to promote the scientific and technical accuracy of
SDSS-III publications and ensure that fair credit is given to the
authors and to other individuals who have contributed to the
SDSS-III. In addition, SDSS-III participants should be encouraged to
carry out excellent science with the database and to publish their
results in a timely manner. By agreeing collectively on how
publication issues will be handled, we aim to minimize future
disagreement among SDSS-III participants. Unless explicitly stated
otherwise, this document applies to publications based on data taken
with the SDSS-III telescopes and instruments, which are not yet in the
public domain, as well as data taken with the survey equipment during
commissioning periods.</p>


<p>This policy applies to: papers submitted to electronic archives and
refereed journals; scientific or technical books or book sections
about the SDSS-III and its results; graphical or tabular materials or
discussions of results, in electronic or hard-copy form, that are
based on analysis of unreleased SDSS-III data and are generally
accessible to non-SDSS participants (e.g., via a public WWW site or a
publicly distributed preprint). The special cases of colloquia,
conference presentations, conference proceedings papers, and theses
are discussed in Section 7. Communications which are not directly
covered by this document, but the dissemination of which should be
consistent with it, include: popular articles and books, circulars,
telegrams, electronic announcements, press releases, and press
conferences.</p>

<p>Responsibility for oversight of SDSS publications rests with the
SDSS-III Scientific Spokesperson. The SDSS-III Collaboration Council
(hereafter CoCo), which serves as an advisory body to the
Spokesperson, has been charged with formulating this Publication
Policy and ensuring that it is efficiently implemented to the benefit
of the collaboration. The CoCo consists of one member from each
Participating Institution with three or more Participants, plus one
member who represents, and is elected by, the Associate Institutions
with fewer than three Participants.</p>

<p>As the Survey progresses, the Spokesperson may revise this Publication
Policy from time to time in what he or she perceives to be the best
interests of (and in consultation with) the collaboration.</p>

<h2 id="papers">2. Types of Papers</h2>

<p>We distinguish three types of publication: "scientific papers",
"technical papers", and "data release papers". Scientific papers are
based on analyses of, or presentations of, the SDSS-III
data. Technical papers describe the SDSS-III instrumentation,
calibration, software, strategy, and targeting algorithms. Technical
papers may include some SDSS-III data for illustrative purposes. Data
release papers describe the contents of SDSS-III data releases to the
public.</p>

<h2 id="coordinators">3. Publication Coordinators</h2>

<p>Logistical responsibility for handling scientific, technical, and
data release papers will rest with the Scientific Publications
Coordinator (SPC), Technical Publications Coordinator (TPC), and
Scientific Spokesperson, respectively. Unresolved disputes about
publication matters will be settled by an Ombudsperson. The SDSS-III
Director, in consultation with the Management Committee, will appoint
the SPC and TPC, while the Ombudsperson is appointed by the ARC Board
as outlined in the SDSS-III PoO.  The Publications Coordinators will
ensure that publications follow the publication process outlined in
Section 7 below. To aid in this process, they will maintain a common
electronic WWW-based archive of all scientific, technical, and data
release publications of the SDSS-III, hereafter the Publications
Archive, with accompanying graphical and tabular material. The
Publications Archive shall be accessible to the participants only. The
Publications Archive will contain the following proprietary
information and links to public documents:</p>

<ol class="i">
<li> projects under investigation or in preparation,</li>

<li> papers available for review by the collaboration</li>

<li> papers approved for public distribution and journal submission</li>

<li> other SDSS-III documents of general interest, such as related
papers by SDSS-III participants not based upon SDSS-III data, common
proposals, etc.</li>

<li> the SDSS-III acknowledgement script required on publications (Section 7.6)</li>

<li> the current list of SDSS-III Architects and participants (Sections 4 &amp; 5)</li>

<li> the current version of this Publication Policy.</li>
</ol>

<p>The papers in this archive that have been approved for public
distribution can therefore be used by any SDSS-III participant for
purposes of public presentation, review articles, etc.</p>

<p>The Scientific Spokesperson will have overall responsibility for the
Publications Archive. The TPC will maintain a complete list of
technical publications describing the hardware, software, etc on the
Publications Archive. The SPC is responsible for assuring that all
SDSS-III papers (scientific, technical, and data release) reference
the appropriate technical papers. The TPC will help coordinate
publication of these technical papers to ensure that technical
documentation of the project is disseminated efficiently and
promptly. The Scientific Spokesperson will coordinate the publication
of the data release papers.</p>


<h2 id="participants">4. Participants </h2>

<p> Participants are defined in Section 3.1 of the SDSS-III PoO. An
updated list of participants shall be maintained by the Spokesperson,
with input from the participating institutions. All participants must
read and agree to the contents of this document before accessing the
SDSS-III data. All participants must follow the rules of authorship
and publication described in this document. Those who violate these
rules are subject to losing their participant status.</p>

<p> The Spokesperson will keep the list of participants up-to-date and
posted on the Publication Archive.</p>

<h3>4.1 Non-Participants </h3>

<p>According to Section 3.1 of the SDSS-III PoO, Participants may
request permission to share a limited and approved portion of the SDSS
proprietary data archive with non-Participants of the SDSS-III for
collaborative research on a specific topic or project.. The policy
regarding use of proprietary SDSS data by these non-participants, or
external collaborators, can be found in the</p>

<p><a href="collaboration/ext_collaborator.php"> Policy for external collaborators
</a></p>


<p>Once granted limited data access, non-participants must read and
agree to the contents of this document and follow the rules described
herein. Non-participants violating these rules are subject to losing
their data access.</p>

<h2 id="architects">5. Architects</h2>

<p>In order to ensure that proper credit is given to those who were
responsible for the construction and maintenance of the hardware,
software, and other infrastructure of the SDSS, a list of "architects"
will be maintained by the Spokesperson and posted on the Publication
Archive.</p>

<h3> 5.1 Construction of the Architect list </h3>


<p>Architects are those who have made substantial contributions to the
SDSS-III hardware and software as a whole, including (but not limited
to) the areas of optics, telescope, infrastructure, calibration,
camera, spectrographs, data reduction and archiving software,
commissioning, management, and major fundraising. The definition of
"substantial contribution" is a total of one year of effort across the
whole SDSS-III collaboration (see SDSS-III PoO as well). This can
include multiple small (part-time) contributions to all the SDSS-III
surveys that total to a year of effort spread over several years. Work
done for SDSS-I/II does not count to this total.</p>

<p>To request Architect status, an individual (or someone acting on
behalf of the proposed Architect, e.g., a CoCo representative) should
submit a brief summary of their contributions to the CoCo for
assessment. The justification must extend beyond merely being on the
SDSS-III payroll, or being involved in SDSS-III science activity, for
the appropriate length of time.</p>

<p>The request should also include which of the four main SDSS-III
surveys (MARVELS, BOSS, SEGUE, APOGEE) the Architect status is
requested for. Requests for multiple (or all) SDSS-III surveys are
allowed and encouraged, but should be justified, e.g., people making
contributions to the general SDSS-III infrastructure (telescope, data
archives, etc.) that aids all four of the SDSS-III surveys. The CoCo
will then make a formal recommendation to the MC (who makes the final
approval) on all requests for Architect status and may restrict that
recommendation to particular SDSS-III surveys based on the details of
the request and the CoCo discussions.</p>

<p>The Scientific Spokesperson will keep the Architect list up-to-date
(with details of which surveys apply) and posted to the Collaboration
web page. Since individuals become members of the above lists by dint
of work already performed, they cannot be removed unless they
explicitly request removal. Architects remain on the Architect list
when they leave an SDSS-III participating institution, and even in the
unlikely event that they commit sufficient infractions to have their
data rights revoked.</p>

<p>Once approved, an Architect can add their names to any science
paper from the surveys they have been approved for. This benefit does
not extend to technical papers as the author list of such papers will
be directly related to the people working on a particular component or
subsystem (see Section 6). As stated in Section 6.1.1, Architects
adding their names to SDSS-III paper should have read and broadly
understood the main contents and results of these papers, especially
items close to their expertise and contribution(s).</p>

<h2 id="authorship">6. Authorship </h2>

<h3> 6.1 Scientific papers </h3>

<h4> 6.1.1 Author inclusion </h4>

<p>At the very least, any scientific paper will include in its author
list any individual who has contributed to the scientific analyses
presented, along with all architects who have requested authorship. In
addition, in Section 6.2 of the SDSS-III PoO, it states that "Any
member of SDSS-III who is authorized to have access to the Science
Archive may, at any stage of a research project within the SDSS-III
collaboration, request that his/her name be added to the list of
authors, with the presumption that permission will be granted if he or
she has made any significant contribution to that specific research
project.” With the exception of architects, those requesting
co-authorship should include a brief description of their
contributions to the project. Authorship requests should be made to
the paper's team contact (see Section 7). Project teams are expected
to err on the side of inclusion in response to such requests.</p>

<p>Anyone who has been placed on a paper's author list may make a request
to the paper's team contact at any time that her or his name be
removed from the paper and it shall be removed.</p>

<p>We stress that all authors should have read and broadly understood
the content of all papers they are co-authors on. This is statement
reflects the spirit of the <a
href="http://www.aps.org/policy/statements/02_2.cfm"> professional
guidelines outlined by the APS </a>, as cited in the PoO-III.</p>

<p>During the three-week period that the paper is available to the
collaboration (see Section 7.1.ii), the SPC will check that the author
list on each scientific paper is appropriate and that the appropriate
technical papers are cited. Disputes about author inclusion will be
settled by the Ombudsperson, whose decisions will be final.</p>

<h4> 6.1.2 Two-group author order </h4>

<p>The scientific achievements of the SDSS will truly be collaboration
achievements, because the SDSS hardware and software make possible
projects that would in many cases be inconceivable without them (or
without some similarly ambitious undertaking). However, an authorship
policy that strictly recognizes all scientific papers purely as
products of the collaboration (e.g., alphabetical authorship on all
papers) runs the risk of making the individuals in the project
effectively anonymous, and it provides little incentive for project
participants to analyze the data quickly rather than wait for data to
become public. Therefore, for most SDSS-III scientific publications,
the order of authorship will follow a "two-group" system. The first
group of authors, the "analysis group", will consist of those who were
heavily involved in the specific analysis described in the paper and
in the writing of the paper. The other group will consist of all other
authors on the paper and will be ordered alphabetically after the
analysis group authors.</p>

<p>Membership in the analysis group and order of authorship within the
analysis group should be decided by those involved in writing the
paper, just as they would decide on membership and order in the author
list if they were writing a non-SDSS science paper. In the event of a
disagreement about membership in the analysis group or order of
authorship, the authors may present their cases to the Ombudsperson,
whose decisions will be final.</p>

<p>The analysis group is always permitted to merge the two author
groups and make the author order alphabetical.</p>

<h3> 6.2 Technical papers </h3>

<p>Those who have worked on a particular component or subsystem will
author the appropriate technical paper, with author order decided by
the authors. Disputes may be taken to the Ombudsperson, whose
decisions will be final. See Section 7.2 below.</p>

<h3> 6.3 Data-release publications </h3>

<p>The Scientific Spokesperson and the Chairs of the Survey Science Teams
(SSTs) shall be responsible for the production of journal papers that
describe all of the SDSS-III data releases. The Spokesperson and SST
Chairs, in consultation with the CoCo, shall also determine the author
list, which for these papers will be alphabetical. Those who have
contributed to the writing of the data release paper, or who have
contributed in a substantive way (typically one month contribution) to
the creation or science validation of the data described in the paper,
are eligible to be authors.</p>

<h3> 6.4 Conference proceedings </h3>

<p>Because of the practical constraints of page limits, submissions to
conference proceedings are not required to follow the authorship
policy above. However, any conference paper that does not follow this
authorship policy may only include quantitative results (tables and
figures, for example) based on papers that have been published or
submitted for publication, and it must reference those papers as the
primary source for the results. The rationale for this requirement is
that conference papers authored by a single author or a small group
should not become the primary reference for results that are properly
products of the SDSS-III Collaboration. Conference proceedings which
are primarily overviews of the SDSS-III project status or scientific
results should include the byline "for the SDSS-III Collaboration"
after the list of authors.</p>

<h3> 6.5 Theses </h3>

<p>Whether they would otherwise qualify as scientific or technical
papers, some undergraduate or graduate theses will be authored by a
single author. However, it is required that the author will
acknowledge the contribution of the SDSS-III collaboration and
reference the papers describing the thesis results that have been
published in or submitted to research journals.</p>

<h2 id="procedure">7. Publication Procedure </h2>

<h3> 7.1 Scientific papers </h3>

<p>To ensure that SDSS-III publications fairly represent the
contributions of those involved and that publications are vetted in a
timely and efficient manner, scientific papers based on unreleased
SDSS-III data will be handled as follows:</p>

<ol class="i">

<li><p>As soon as a specific scientific investigation begins, a project
team of SDSS-III participants should identify a team contact who must
then submit to the SDSS-III Projects Web Page (see link below) a
project title, a list of current project members, and a brief abstract
of the intended project. An electronic announcement of the project
should then be automatically sent to the collaboration (e.g. via the
sdss3-general email list). At this, and any other stage of the
process, other SDSS-III participants can join the project.</p>

<p>Follow <a
href="https://sdss3.org/internal/publications/cgi-bin/projects.pl">
this link</a> for details of how project announcements can be
posted. This page requires the "standard"
SDSS-III username/password.</p></li>

<li><p>When a draft of the scientific paper has been written, the
project team must post the paper to the Publication Archive (see
below) as a "pending" paper, and an electronic notification is sent to
the collaboration (e.g., via an automatic message sent to the
sdss3-general email list). This announcement must indicate the journal
to which the paper will be submitted. SDSS-III participants then have
three weeks to make comments, request co-authorship, etc, to the
project team contact (with copies sent to the SPC). To streamline the
process, an automated system to query architects or respond positively
to their authorship requests should be used. The team contact is
required to circulate substantive comments received on the paper's
content, along with the team's response. The project team revises the
paper in response to the comments and other requests it deems
valid. The SPC, or a representative of the SPC, also checks that the
authorship, references, and acknowledgements fairly represent the
contributions made to the publication, in particular checking that the
appropriate SDSS-III technical publications are referenced. The SPC
carries out this duty within the same three week period. A publication
can be withdrawn at any stage of this process.</p>

<p>Follow <a
href="https://sdss3.org/internal/publications/cgi-bin/publications.pl">
this link</a> for details of how to announce SDSS-III
publications. This page requires the "standard"
SDSS-III username/password.</p></li>


<li> The authors revise the paper according to comments and
suggestions from the collaboration. At the end of the three week
period, or at the end of the revision process (whichever is longer),
the final version of the paper is posted to the Publications Archive
and, as a professional courtesy, a final version of the paper should
be sent to all co-authors by the lead author(s) 48 hours before
submission to a journal (and/or the arXiv archive) to solicit any
final critical comments or issues. After this final stage, the paper,
its results and accompanying material may normally be submitted for
publication in a journal and to the arXiv archive (the latter is left
to the discretion of the lead author(s)). The paper is not considered
public until its embargo is lifted by the lead author(s), as indicated
at its posting in the Publications Archive (or until its appearance in
the arXiv archive, or the publication to which it was submitted,
should the lead author(s) neglect to lift the embargo before
then). Until the embargo is lifted, the paper and its results cannot
be quoted in public, referenced in other publications, etc. without
the permission of the lead author(s).</li>

<li> When a project team makes revisions in response to an external
referee report, it should post the final accepted or published version
on the Publications Archive.  In cases of disputes about credit,
authorship, or scientific results, the SPC shall work with the
author(s) and SDSS-III participants to resolve them. In cases where a
dispute cannot be resolved, the matter may be appealed to the
Ombudsperson, whose decisions will be final.</li>

</ol>

<p>Publications based on projects started with proprietary SDSS-III
data should follow the publication procedure outlined in this section,
even if the data being used has become public during the project and
before any publications have been finished and posted to the SDSS-III
publication page. This was standard practice in SDSS-I/II.</p>

<h3> 7.2 Technical papers </h3>

<p>As technical papers have a special status within the SDSS-III,
prospective authors of any technical papers should first consult with
the chair of their appropriate SST (or TPC if equally applicable to
all four SDSS-III surveys) for confirmation of this special status. If
this pre-approval as a technical paper is granted, then the paper
should follow the procedure below. In addition, the TPC can suggest
technical papers that should be written and work with the Chair of the
SSTs to ensure they are published in a timely fashion.</p>

<ol class="i">

<li> When a technical paper is drafted, it is posted to the
Publications Archive. This announcement must indicate the journal to
which the paper will be submitted. The TPC, or a representative of the
TPC, will review the paper to ensure that the authorship, references,
and acknowledgements fairly represent the contributions made to the
publication.</li>

<li>The TPC and SDSS-III participants will have three weeks to send
comments to/request changes from the lead author. Copies of
participant comments should also be sent to the TPC.</li>

<li>The lead author posts the final draft on the Publications Archive
and submits the paper to the appropriate journal and the arXiv
archive. The contents of the paper may thereafter be quoted in public
presentations, etc., by SDSS-III participants.</li>

<li> When a technical paper is revised in response to an external
referee report, the lead author will post the final version on the
Publication Archive.</li>

</ol>

<p>In the case of disputes about technical publications, which the TPC
cannot resolve, the matter may be appealed to the Ombudsperson, whose
decisions will be final.</p>


<h3> 7.3 Data Release Papers </h3>

<p>Major releases of SDSS-III data will be accompanied by a paper (or
papers) describing the contents of these data releases. Such papers
will be coordinated by the Scientific Spokesperson and the SST Chairs,
and posted to the SDSS-III archives for three weeks for comment by the
collaboration. The Spokesperson and SST Chairs will construct the
author list(s), which should contain all appropriate SDSS-III
participants and be in alphabetical order.</p>

<h3> 7.4 MARVELS Planet Detection Papers </h3>

<p>The credibility and scientific success of MARVELS hinges on the
reliability of its planet discoveries and characterizations, which
could be easily undermined by erroneous claims.  Therefore, a MARVELS
paper that presents the first public announcement of a planet
candidate must be subject to higher level of internal scrutiny than
discussed in Section 7.2 above. Therefore, the Chair of the MARVELS
Survey Science Team, in consultation with the MARVELS PI and Project
Scientist, is allowed to delay the submission of any MARVELS paper
that presents the first public announcement of a planet candidate if
he/she considers the strength of the evidence for this candidate to be
insufficient. Note that this also applies to papers that are derived
directly from planet candidates discovered from unpublished MARVELS
data, even if the MARVELS data are not included, as this effectively
represents the first public announcement of the candidate.</p>

<p>Any imposed delay may not exceed six months from the time that the
paper is first posted in complete form to the Publication Archive.
Also, the delayed paper may be submitted as soon as any other SDSS-III
paper that includes the candidate is submitted, and it may also be
posted to ArXiv simultaneously with the ArXiv posting of any other
paper that includes the candidate, or upon acceptance by a journal if
that happens earlier.  The decision by the Chair of the MARVELS Survey
Science Team to delay submission of a paper can be appealed to the
Spokesperson first, and then the Ombudsman, whose decision is final.</p>

<h3> 7.5 Colloquia, conference presentations, and conference
proceedings </h3>

<p> In oral or display presentations, colloquium or conference
speakers and presenters may, upon consultation with the project team
contact, make use of unpublished SDSS-III results (with the exceptions
noted in 7.1.iii above) and are expected to give appropriate credit to
the SDSS-III Collaboration and to those involved in producing the
results shown or described. This policy also covers digital
presentation slides published on conference websites soon after
speakers have delivered their presentations. In such cases, only
material presented in public by the speakers can be posted to
conference websites (i.e., extra slides containing unpublished results
must be removed if not presented in public as part of the talk).</p>

<p>Conference proceedings are required to follow the publication
procedure described in this Section. In special cases, given the
realities of conference proceedings submission deadlines, the authors
may request from the Spokesperson an exception from some or all of the
publication process requirements. Such requests should be submitted at
least three weeks prior to the submission deadline.</p>

<p>Applications for talks/presentations at the annual American
Astronomical Society (AAS) meetings should be announced to the
appropriate SST mailing lists at least two weeks before formal
submission of any abstract. Any conflicts that arise from such
postings will be resolved by the SDSS-III Spokesperson, but in cases
where a dispute cannot be resolved, the matter may be appealed to the
Ombudsperson, whose decision will be final.</p>

<h3> 7.6 Theses </h3>

<p> All theses in which SDSS-III data play an essential role must be
announced to the collaboration when they are begun, just as with other
publications (see Section 7.1 above). It is the responsibility of each
SDSS-III institution to work out a process for publishing theses which
is consistent with both SDSS-III and departmental policies.</p>

<p>Theses based on SDSS-III data should not be distributed to the
public via the WWW or other electronic archives until either the data
on which it is based are public or journal articles describing its
main results have been published or submitted for publication. Any
such distribution should note the journal articles describing the
results, so that they can be appropriately cited by others.</p>

<p>The SDSS-III Spokesperson will maintain a list of approved SDSS-III
theses in the Publication Archive. The contents of this list are
included in quarterly and annual reports to demonstrate the
contribution of the SDSS to graduate education.</p>

<h3> 7.7 Standard acknowledgement </h3>

<p>All SDSS papers that fall under the purview of this policy must
contain the standard SDSS-III acknowledgement, which is maintained by
the Spokesperson and posted on the Publications Archive. If a
conference proceeding is subject to a tight length constraint (four
pages or less), the author may submit a request, to the appropriate
publications coordinator, to include only part of the acknowledgement.</p>

<h3> 7.8 Dissemination of Time-critical Information </h3>

<p>The SDSS-III will detect time-variable events and/or objects for
which timely dissemination to the broader astronomical community will
pay big scientific dividends. Participants who carry out programs with
SDSS-III data that detect time-critical events are encouraged to
report these to the collaboration as a whole, and to the broader
community through IAU Circulars and the like. Given the space
constraints and expense of IAU Circulars, the attribution for the
report should read "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (see
http://www.sdss3.org/) reports...". Relevant finding charts,
positions, and photometry drawn from the SDSS-III data set can be
released. Publication of time-critical results can also request to the
Spokesperson and CoCo for a shorter review period (outlined in Section
7.1) if the scientific dividends are high and/or there is a fear of
being scooped by others not part of the SDSS-III collaboration. Such
cases will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis by the CoCo and
Spokesperson.</p>

<p>Participants who wish to regularly release substantial amounts of
time-critical data, such as positions and photometry of asteroids,
must request approval from the SDSS-III Management Committee. Upon
approval, the project must be posted to the Publications Page under
the category of "On-line Catalog". At this point the project falls
under the rules governing Scientific Publications (three week posting
period, authorship rules). Since some (if not all) of these
publications will be "living documents", individuals who contribute to
the publication but were not part of the project when it was
originally posted can, with approval of the lead author, be added to
the list of authors at any time.</p>

<h2 id="charges">8. Page Charges </h2>

<p>SDSS-III funds will not be used to pay page charges for any
scientific paper. The SDSS-III will pay page charges for approved
technical and data release papers, subject to the budget.</p>
