<dt id="adaptive_moment">Adaptive Moments</dt>

<dd>
A method of measuring object shapes (<em>i.e.</em>, fitting those shapes to ellipses).
These moments are close to optimal for measuring the shapes of faint galaxies,
and have been used for weak lensing studies. See the

<dt id="ancillary" class="9 10">Ancillary Target (BOSS)</dt>

<dd>
Spectroscopic target selection in <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#BOSS">BOSS</a>
is dominated by two categories: <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#luminous_red_galaxy">LRGs</a>,
and quasars. However, a small fraction of the fibers are devoted to a variety of additional
projects, ranging from studies of variable stars to host galaxies of supernovae.
These additional targets are referred to as BOSS Ancillary Targets.
A full list of the target flags may be found in the descriptions of
<a href="drXX/algorithms/bitmask_ancillary_target1.php">ANCILLARY_TARGET1</a>
and <a href="drXX/algorithms/bitmask_ancillary_target2.php">ANCILLARY_TARGET2</a>.

<dt id="APOGEE">APOGEE</dt>

<dd>The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment, one of
four surveys included in SDSS-III.
This is using a high-resolution (R~22,500) H-band spectrograph fed by 300
fibers. The spectrograph saw first light in 2011, and the survey will
observe roughly 100,000 stars, mostly in the disk of the Milky Way, to obtain
detailed chemical compositions and kinematics.  The first data from
APOGEE was released publicly in Data Release 10.</dd>

<dt id="asinh">Asinh Magnitude</dt>

<dd>Magnitudes within SDSS-I/II are expressed as inverse
hyperbolic sine (or "asinh") magnitudes, sometimes referred to informally as
<em>luptitudes</em>. The transformation from linear flux measurements to
asinh magnitudes is designed to be virtually identical to the standard
astronomical magnitude at high signal-to-noise ratio, but to switch over to
linear behavior at low S/N and even at negative values of flux, where the
logarithm in the <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#mag_pogson">Pogson magnitude</a>
fails.  Details can be found in the
<a href="drXX/algorithms/magnitudes.php">Photometry section</a> of the

<dt id="Astrda">AstroDA</dt>

<dd>The data acquisition and analysis system used to collect data from the survey telescope cameras.</dd>

<dt id="Astrom">Astrom</dt>

<dd>The data processing pipeline that maps CCD pixel coordinates to celestial
coordinates. The detailed workings of this pipeline are described in the
<a href="drXX/algorithms/astrometry.php">Astrometry</a> section of the
<a href="drXX/algorithms/">algorithms pages</a>, or the

<dt id="astrom_chip">Astrometric Chip</dt>

<dd>The SDSS <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#camera">camera</a>
contains 24 2048x400 pixel CCDs (in addition to the 30 2048x2048
photometric CCDs) which were used for astrometry and focus
monitoring. Because they are smaller chips, the effective exposure
time is only 11 seconds, allowing the survey to observe brighter stars
without saturation. These bright star positions were necessary to match
to objects present in astrometric catalogs used by the <a
href="drXX/help/glossary.php#Astrom">Astrom pipeline</a>. They are no longer used for this purpose; soon after
SDSS operations started, the UCAC catalog of astrometric standards faint enough
not to be saturated in the main SDSS chips became available.
For more details on these chips,
please see the appropriate section of the <a
href="instruments/camera.php">camera page</a> or the AJ

<dt id="astrotools">Astrotools</dt>

<dd>A software environment in which several of the SDSS pipelines are run,
including the image processing pipeline, <code>photo</code>.</dd>

<dt id="atlas_image">Atlas Image</dt>

<dd>For each detected <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#object">object</a>, the atlas image
comprises the pixels that were detected as part of the object in any

single file for each field.</dd>

<!-- BBBBB -->

<dt id="binned_frame">Binned Frame</dt>

<dd>Each file is a FITS image for one filter, 512 x 372 pixels, with WCS
information. These are the
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#corrected_frame">corrected frames</a> with
detected objects removed and binned 4 pixels by 4 pixels. All pixels
that are in <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#atlas_image">atlas images</a> are
replaced by the background level before binning, with suitable noise added.
All of the header parameters from the original image are inherited as well.

<dt id="blackbook">Black Book</dt>

<dd>See <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#project_book">Project Book</a>.</dd>

<dt id="BONUS">BONUS quasars</dt>

<dd>The principal science goal of the BOSS quasar sample is to measure the
clustering signal in the Lyman-&alpha; forest, which does not require that the
quasar sample be uniformly selected across the sky. While the
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#CORE">CORE quasars</a> are uniformly selected,
an additional 20 quasars per square degree, the BONUS quasars, are selected using
a combination of techniques and available data that is not required to be
uniformly selected. See also <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#CORE">CORE quasars</a>.</dd>

<dt id="boresight">Boresight</dt>

<dd>The telescope control computer keeps track
of a specific point in the telescope focal plane that is called the
<em>boresight</em>. The boresight is not fixed in the array but is at one of two
places for the two <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#strip">strips</a> that
compose a <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#stripe">stripe</a>. It is the
boresight that will track <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#great_circle_coords">great
circles</a>. Technically, the boresight tracks a path that is a great circle
in J2000 coordinates as viewed from the solar system barycenter.</dd>

<dt id="BOSS">BOSS</dt>

<dd>The Baryon Oscillation Sky Survey, one of the four component surveys
of SDSS-III.  It is obtaining redshifts of 1.5 million galaxies, and spectra
of 150,000 z &gt; 2.2 quasars, to measure the baryon oscillation signal in the
correlation function as a geometrical probe of cosmology.  It also obtained
imaging over roughly 3100 deg<sup>2</sup> of the Southern Galactic Cap beyond
that in SDSS-I/II.  It uses substantially improved spectrographs over those
used in SDSS-I and SDSS-II, with more fibers per plate (1000 vs. 640),
smaller fiber aperture (2", not 3"), improved throughput,
and somewhat wider wavelength coverage.</dd>

<dt id="bright">BRIGHT detections</dt>

<dd>A technical term in the photometric reductions.  The photometric
pipeline performs a first-pass detection that searches for very
significant objects, which are typically bright stars and galaxy, in
preparation for the full object detection algorithm.  These objects
are measured and included in the final catalog, but never as <a
href="drXX/help/glossary.php#surveyprimary">survey primary</a> or <a
href="drXX/help/glossary.php#surveysecondary">survey secondary</a>
objects. All such objects are redetected and remeasured in the
second-pass of the pipeline, and those (non-BRIGHT) detections are the
ones to actually use. BRIGHT detections have the BRIGHT bit set in
their <a href="drXX/algorithms/bitmask_flags1.php">photometric
flags</a>.</dd>

<!-- CCCCC -->

<dt id="calibration">Calibration</dt>

<dd>The process by which the photometric and spectroscopic observations are
calibrated. The goal of calibration is to take the digital camera readouts
and convert them to measured quantities like fluxes. The details of these
procedures can be found on the <a href="drXX/algorithms/">algorithms pages</a>.</dd>

<dt id="camcol">Camcol</dt>

<dd>A Camcol is the output of one camera column of CCDs (each with a different
filter) as part of a <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#run">Run</a>. Therefore,
1 Camcol = 1/6 of a Run. It is also a portion of a
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#scanline">scanline</a>.</dd>

<dt id="camera">Camera</dt>

<dd>The instrument used for imaging in SDSS. It consists of 30
photometric and 24 astrometric CCDs (see the <a
href="instruments/camera.php">camera description</a>).  The
camera is a mosaic of 54 CCD detectors in the focal plane, 30 large
devices arranged in 6 columns of 5 each and 24 smaller devices around
the periphery. See this <a href="images/camassy2.gif">sketch
of the camera focal plane</a> or this <a
href="images/faceplat.gif">real life image</a>. The camera is
described in detail in the imaging camera paper (<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AJ....116.3040G">Gunn et
al. 1998</a>). The last imaging data in SDSS was released in DR8; the
camera has now been decommissioned. </dd>

<dt id="CAS">CAS (Catalog Archive Server)</dt>

<dd>The <a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/drXX/">Catalog Archive Server</a>
is a searchable database that contains the measured parameters from all objects in the imaging
survey and the spectroscopic survey.</dd>

<dt id="casjobs">CasJobs</dt>

<dd>A batch (asynchronous) interface to the <a
href="drXX/help/glossary.php#CAS">CAS</a> for querying the database and
storing results. CasJobs is designed to handle especially long or otherwise demanding queries.</dd>

<dt id="caveats">Caveats</dt>

<dd>Also known as "known problems."  SDSS maintains a list of issues or
imperfections of the data and/or its processing. We have a list of <a
href="drXX/imaging/caveats.php">imaging caveats</a>, <a
href="drXX/spectro/caveats.php">(optical) spectroscopic caveats</a>,
and <a href="drXX/irspec/caveats.php">infrared spectrosopic caveats</a>.</dd>

<dt id="central_meridian">Central Meridian</dt>

<dd>The meridian which passes through the center of the survey area in
the Northern Galactic Cap, 12h&nbsp;20m, defines the central meridian of an
imaging scan. The great circle perpendicular to it passing through the survey
center at δ = 32.8&deg; is the
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#survey_equator">survey equator</a>.</dd>

<dt id="child">Child</dt>

<dd>A product of the <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#deblend">deblending</a> process
in the image processing. When two objects are near each other on the sky,
their images may appear merged. The deblender tries to split this merged
image; the resulting sub-images are called children. The initial merged
image is called a <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#parent">parent</a>. For more
details, see the <a href="drXX/algorithms/deblend.php">Deblending</a>
section of the <a href="drXX/algorithms/">algorithms pages</a>.</dd>

<dt id="classification">Classification (photometric)</dt>

<dd>The method by which we assign a type (star or galaxy) to each
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#object">object</a> in the SDSS images.
The details of this procedure are described in the
<a href="drXX/algorithms/classify.php">Classification</a> section of the
<a href="drXX/algorithms/">algorithms pages</a>; in brief, it is based on the
difference between PSF and model magnitudes.</dd>

<dt id="cloud_cam">Cloud Camera</dt>

<dd>A camera at the mountain that takes continuous pictures
of the sky at 10&nbsp;&mu;m, a wavelength at which clouds emit.
It is a sensitive measure of the photometricity of the sky as a
function of time. It is described <a href="http://irsc.apo.nmsu.edu/irsc_doc/">here</a>.</dd>

<dt id="cloud_cam_status">Cloud Camera Status</dt>

<dd><p>The cloud camera status is built from an analysis of the 10&nbsp;&mu;m
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#cloud_cam">cloud cameras</a>
used at the APO site. The full history is stored in two
files in the <a href="drXX/software/products.php">photoop product</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>opfiles/opCloudcam.par (when was the cloudcam on)</li>
<li>opfiles/opCloudveto.par (when was it cloudy)</li>
</ul>
<p>The software generating these files from the raw IRCAM data is in
pro/ircam.</p>
<p>In individual files in the reductions the CLOUDCAM flag gets set
with the following possible values:</p>
<ul>
<li>-1 : UNKNOWN (cloud camera not on)</li>
<li>0 : CLOUDY (cloud camera indicates clouds)</li>
<li>1 : CLEAR (cloud camera indicates clear)</li>
</ul>

<dt id="false">Color Image Pipeline</dt>

<dd>A pipeline to produce 3-color JPG files of zoomed-down SDSS images; these are
available from the CAS.</dd>

<dt id="convex">Convex</dt>

<dd>A convex is the intersection of one or more circles, with a depth (the number of circles
involved). If we have two intersection circles, A and B, then both (A) and (B) are a convex
of depth 1, their intersection (A)(B) is also a convex, but of depth 2. We call these simple
convexes "wedges."</dd>

<dt id="coordinates">Coordinates</dt>

<dd>The SDSS uses several different coordinate systems. We use
standard astronomical right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec),
J2000. There is also the <em><a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#survey_coords">survey
coordinate system</a></em>, with coordinates <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#lambda">&lambda;</a>
and <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#eta">&eta;</a>. This is just a rotation of the usual RA, Dec
system. There is a variant on this known
	as <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#corrected_survey_coords">corrected survey
	coordinates</a> with different ranges for &lambda; and &eta;. There is the
    <em><a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#great_circle_coords">great
circle coordinate system</a></em>, which is actually a separate
coordinate system for each <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#stripe">stripe</a>. The
coordinates of this system are <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#mu">&mu;</a> and
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#nu">&nu;</a>. For APOGEE infrared spectra in Data Release
10 and later, we also use galactic coordinates: galactic longitude (L) and galactic latitude (B).
(Note that our convention is to use capital letters to symbolize galactic coordinates to avoid
confusion between the lowercase letter l and the number 1). The algorithms pages have
<a href="drXX/algorithms/surveycoords.php">details on all these coordinate systems</a>.</dd>

<dt id="corrected_frame">Corrected Frame</dt>

<dd>Each corrected frame is a FITS image for one filter, 2048 columns by
1489 rows, with row number increasing in the scan direction. These are the
imaging frames with flat-field, bias, cosmic-ray, and pixel-defect corrections
applied, sky subtracted, and photometric calibration applied. A raw image
contains 1361 rows, and a corrected frame has the first 128 rows of the
following corrected frame appended to it. The pixels subtend 0".396 square
on the sky. Header information using the
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#wcs">world coordinate system (WCS)</a> allows
standard astronomical FITS tools to convert pixel position to right
ascension and declination. Available in the
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#SAS">SAS</a>.</dd>

<dt id="corrected_survey_coords">Corrected Survey Coordinates</dt>

<dd>A variant on
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#survey_coords">Survey Coordinates</a>,

<dt id="CORE">CORE quasars</dt>

<dd>In the BOSS survey, 20 quasar targets per square degree are selected for
spectroscopy using a spatially uniform technique, called "CORE," allowing science
requiring a uniform selection of quasars to be done. The CORE algorithm starting
in the second year of BOSS is the "extreme deconvolution" technique,

<dt id="deblend">Deblend</dt>

<dd>Deblending is the process by which overlapping objects in images are
separated. The <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#frames_pipeline">frames pipeline</a>
attempts to determine whether each object actually consists of
more than one object projected on the sky and, if so, to deblend
such a <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#parent">parent</a> object into its
constituent <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#child">children</a>, self-consistently
across the bands (thus, all children have measurements in all bands). For

paper</a>.</dd>

<dt id="ellipticity">Ellipticity</dt>

<dd><p>Measures how elliptical an object in the imaging data is. In
the SDSS, we have numerous methods to measure this:</p>

<li>the <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#adaptive_moment">adaptive moments</a></li>

<li>fits to <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#exp">exponential profiles</a></li>
<li>the isophotal parameters (discontinued)</li>
</ul></dd>

<dt id="eta">eta (&eta;)</dt>

<dd>Latitude in the
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#survey_coords">survey coordinate system</a>.
Eta is the angle between the survey equator and the great circle passing
through the point perpendicular to the survey meridian, positive to the north.
Constant latitude curves are great circles. See the description of <a
href="drXX/algorithms/surveycoords.php">SDSS survey
coordinates</a>.</dd>

<dt id="exp">Exponential Model</dt>

<dd><p>The radial light distribution of a disk galaxy can often be fit by an exponential profile:</p>
<p><var>I</var>(<var>r</var>) = <var>I</var><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;exp(-1.68&nbsp;<var>r</var>/<var>r</var><sub>e</sub>)</p>
<p>The number 1.68 is chosen so that the model radius is a half-light radius.
An elliptical version of this profile is fit to every detected object,
yielding the <code>exp</code> parameters. See the
<a href="drXX/algorithms/magnitudes.php#mag_model">model magnitude section</a>
of the photometry algorithm page for details.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="extinction">Extinction</dt>

<dd>We observe all but the nearest stars through a foreground of dust
extinction from our own Milky Way. The CAS tabulates extinction corrections
in magnitudes at the position of each object, <code>reddening</code>,
following
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...500..525S">Schlegel, Finkbeiner &amp; Davis (1998)</a>.

<dt id="extra_plates">Extra Plates</dt>

<dd>Reobservations of main survey plates, useful for variability studies or checks. See the
<a href="drXX/scope.php">scope</a> page for more information.</dd>

<!-- FFFFF -->

<dt id="family">Family Objects</dt>

<dd>These are objects that are generated when photometric objects are neither primary nor secondary
survey objects but a composite object that has been <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#deblend">deblended</a> or the part
of an object that has been deblended incorrectly (like the spiral arms of a galaxy). These objects
are kept to track how the deblender is working.</dd>

<dt id="fiber">Fiber</dt>

<dd>The SDSS spectrograph uses optical fibers to direct the light at the focal
plane from individual objects to the slithead. Each object is assigned a
corresponding <code>fiberID</code>. The fibers for SDSS-I/II (and for
SEGUE-2 in SDSS-III) were 3 arcsec in diameter in the source plane;
they are 2 arcsec in diameter for BOSS and APOGEE. Each fiber is surrounded by a
large sheath which prevents any pair of fibers from being placed closer
than 55 arcsec on the same <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#plate">plate</a>
(62 arcsec for BOSS). The <a href="instruments/apogee_spectrograph.php">APOGEE
spectrograph</a> employs 300 infrared fibers that each subtend 2 arcsec on the
sky; no two fibers can be placed closer than 71.5 arcsec on a given
plate.  When two targets are closer to each other than this
separation, the highest-priority target is observed.  The other target
may be observed if there is an overlapping plate covering this region.</dd>

<dt id="fiberMag">fiberMag</dt>

<dd>The magnitude measured by the frames pipeline to simulate the flux that
would fall into a 3" fiber in typical seeing. Similarly, fiber2Mag
simulates the 2" fiber magnitude.

<dt id="field">Field (Imaging)</dt>

<dd>A field is a part of a <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#camcol">camcol</a> that is processed
by the <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#photo">Photo pipeline</a> at one time. Fields are
2048 &times; 1489 pixels; a field consists of the <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#frame">frames</a>
in the 5 filters for the same part of the sky. Fields overlap each
other by 128 rows; <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#primary">primaries</a> are decided when
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#run">runs</a> are <a
href="drXX/help/glossary.php#resolve">resolved</a> (basically, using
objects between rows 64 and 1425 as primaries).
See the <a

<dt id="field_apogee" class="10">Field (APOGEE)</dt>

<dd>A <em>field</em> has a different meaning in the context of APOGEE
infrared spectra than it does for imaging. In the
context of APOGEE, a field is a location on the sky, defined by central coordinates and a radius.
Fields can be identified by a string Field Name (e.g. <i>090+08</i>) or an integer
LocationID (e.g. <i>4102</i>).</dd>


<dt id="field-centers" class="10">Field Centers</dt>

<dd>The coordinates of the centers of each <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#field_apogee">APOGEE
field</a>, expressed in galactic coordinates (L and B).</dd>

<dt id="fieldid">fieldID</dt>

<dd>The fieldID parameter is an integer uniquely identifying a detection
in the photo catalog. It needs to be cast as unsigned
64-bit, though in many files we waste a few bytes and write it as an
string to avoid FITS compliance issues.
The bits are assigned exactly as for <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#objid">objid</a>,
but setting the object id within the field to 0.
For IDL users, the function <code>sdss_fieldid()</code> in photoop will convert
RUN, CAMCOL, FIELD, RERUN into a properly formatted fieldID.</dd>

<dt id="filter">Filter</dt>

<dd>The SDSS imaging camera takes images in five filters:
<em>u,g,r,i,z</em> which span the window from 3000 Angstroms to 1
micron.  Please read the
<a href="instruments/camera.php">camera page</a> for details.
This term is used to describe both the physical
filter and to tag parameters as measured through that filter.</dd>

<dt id="FITS">FITS</dt>

<dt id="flag">Flag</dt>
<dd>A bitmask used in the database to specify various properties of an object
in the imaging data. There are many flags in the SDSS catalogs, indicating,
for example, whether the object was
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#deblend">deblended</a> or saturated. There are
status flags set by PSP, and by survey operations, on a
frame-by-frame basis, describing the quality of the PSF, and the
quality of the data overall.  Each object is given status flags
that sort out overlaps.  The spectra have flags at two levels
as well: pixel-by-pixel flags, and warning flags accompanying the
redshifts and classification to indicate trouble.
There is extensive documentation of the image processing flags at the
<a href="drXX/algorithms/photo_flags_recommend.php">flags recommendation page</a>.  The
spectroscopic data are accompanied by their own set of flags. APOGEE also employs
unique data and targeting flags. A full list of values for each flag is
given in the <a href="drXX/algorithms/bitmasks.php">Bitmasks</a> pages.</dd>

coordinates, and counts, not fluxes. Available in the
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#SAS">SAS</a>.</dd>

<dt id="frame">Frame</dt>

<dd>The data stream from a single CCD in a scanline is cut into a series of
frames which measure 2048 &times; 1489 pixels and overlap 10% with the adjacent
frame. The frames in the 5 filters for the same part of the sky are called a
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#field">field</a>.</dd>

<dt id="frames_pipeline">Frames Pipeline</dt>

<dd>This is the core of the image processing of SDSS image data.  In this
pipeline, the images are  bias-subtracted and flat-fielded, and bad columns,
cosmic rays, and bleed trails are interpolated over. This yields
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#corrected_frame">corrected frames</a>.  Then
objects are found by running a PSF-matched filter over the image, and matched
between the five frames making up a field.  A
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#deblend">deblender</a> is run to resolve
overlaps, and the properties of each object are measured and written to the
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#fpObjc">fpObjc</a> files.  Atlas images are written
to the <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#fpAtlas">fpAtlas</a> files.</dd>

<dt id="great_circle_coords">Great Circle Coordinates</dt>

<dd>
<p>One of the main coordinate systems utilized by the SDSS. In this system,
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#mu">&mu;</a> and <a href="drXX/glossary.php#nu">&nu;</a>
are spherical coordinates (corresponding to ra and dec) in a system whose
equator is along the center of the
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#stripe">stripe</a> in question. The stripes of the
main survey in the Northern Galactic Cap are great circles which all cross at
the survey nodes of (RA, Dec) = (95, 0) an (RA, Dec) = (270, 0) degrees.</p>

<p>The scans are defined by their inclination with respect to the equator, and are indexed
by integers <var>n</var> such that the inclination of a stripe is
-25 + 2.5<var>n</var>.</p>

<p>The stripes of the main survey in the South Galactic cap are great circles
with the same nodes, where the indexing is such that the inclination relative
to the equator is 2.5(82 - <var>n</var>). The celestial Equator therefore corresponds
to stripe number 10 in the Northern Cap and 82 in the Southern Cap.  Stripes 1-44 were
observed in the North, and stripes 61 to 90 in the South.
While the imaging scans of the SEGUE survey are also great circles, they have
an assortment of different nodes and are numbered with stripe numbers &gt; 200.</p>

<dt id="idlspec2d">idlspec2d</dt>

<dd>
<p>The spectroscopic pipeline (also sometimes referred to as
Spectro-2D and <code>specBS</code>), which reduces the raw 2D spectral
frames to extracted 1D calibrated spectra (flux density versus wavelength) and then to
redshifts and classifications. </p>

<p>The operational goals of the extraction pipeline are to:</p>

<ol>
<li>interpolate over bad pixels</li>
<li>mask all bad pixels and pixels contaminated by strong sky emission.</li>
<li>bias and dark subtract the raw 2D data frames</li>
<li>trim the frame</li>
<li>flat-field  using calibration frames taken at
the same telescope pointing position before and after an exposure
on the sky.</li>
<li>optimally extract 1D spectra from this 2D frame.</li>
<li>apply wavelength calibration, rebin to a common
wavelength solution, and sky subtract.</li>
<li>coadd the three or more individual exposures for each
object.</li>
<li>put the red and blue halves of the spectrum together.</li>
<li>flux calibrate the spectrum.</li>
</ol>

<p>Following extraction, the <code>idlspec2d</code> pipeline
classifies objects and measures redshifts from the Legacy, SEGUE and
BOSS surveys based on the calibrated 1-dimensional spectra. It fits
spectra to templates in real space, as described in the <a
href="drXX/algorithms/redshifts.php">redshift fitting algorithms
documentation</a>.  This aspect of the <code>idlspec2d</code> has
sometimes been referred to as "specBS".</p>

<p>For SDSS-I/II, there was another pipeline, spec1d, which
cross-correlated spectra to templates in Fourier space; that pipeline
is not being run in SDSS-III.</p>

consider that MJD to be the best observation of that plate, and for it
to be an acceptable observation from a science point of view (with
PLATEQUALITY either 'marginal' or 'good'). It is "0" either if there
is a better observation or if all observations are labeled 'bad'. A
clean set of plates can be selected by demanding that IS_PRIMARY be
equal to one.  Note, however, that just because a plate is marked
'bad' does not always mean its spectra are useless. </dd>

<dt id="IS_TILE">IS_TILE</dt>

<dd>The IS_TILE flag is set for each SDSS/BOSS spectroscopic

associated with in the SDSS Legacy survey.  Tiles are unique RA/Dec
centers.  It is "0" otherwise, or if the plate is not associated with
Legacy.  To get well-defined targeting and window functions, one wants
to use only plates that have IS_TILE of 1.  A plate can be IS_TILE
only if it is also IS_PRIMARY.</dd>

<ol>
<li>a pure de&nbsp;Vaucouleurs profile, and</li>
<li>a pure exponential profile,</li>

is more difficult than for stars, because galaxies do not all have the same radial surface
brightness profile, and have no sharp edges.  In order to avoid
biases, we wish to measure a constant fraction of the total light,
independent of the position and distance of the object. To satisfy these
requirements, the SDSS has adopted a modified form of the
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1976ApJ...209L...1P">Petrosian (1976)</a>
system, measuring galaxy fluxes within a circular aperture whose radius is
defined by the shape of the azimuthally averaged light profile.

<dt id="ObjID">ObjID</dt>

<dd>
<p>A number identifying an object in the image catalog used by the CAS.  It is a

<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#object">object</a>.  Note that when the data are
reprocessed (rerun), the object identification changes, so that the
ObjID value in DR8 and DR9 differ from that of previous data releases.
For spectroscopic objects, there are two possible choices for the matching
photometric measurement: <code>bestObjID</code> corresponds to the
"flux-based" match, which is the object that contributes the most
light at the location of the fiber; <code>origObjID</code> corresponds
to the "position-based" match, which is the object whose center is
closest to the fiber. In a fraction of a percent of cases, these two
identifications differ. We also provide <code>targetObjID</code>,
which is the object identification number corresponding to the object
that was originally targeted (virtually always in a previous rerun,
which we do not include in the DR8 and DR9 releases).</p>

<p>The bits are assigned in objid as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>63</b>: 0, unassigned</li>
<li> <b>59-62</b>: skyVersion 	resolved sky version (for DR8 only
use 2; 0-15 available)</li>
<li> <b>48-58</b>: rerun, number of pipeline rerun </li>
<li> <b>32-47</b>: run, run number</li>
<li> <b>29-31</b>: camcol, camera column (1-6)</li>
<li> <b>28</b>: 0, unassigned</li>
<li> <b>16-27</b>: field, field number within run</li>
<li> <b>0-15</b>: id, object number within field</li>
</ul>
<p>For IDL users, the function "sdss_objid()" in the <a
href="drXX/software/">photoop package distributed with DR9</a> will
convert RUN, CAMCOL, FIELD, ID, RERUN into a properly formatted
objID. The function "unwrap_objid()" will return the RUN, CAMCOL,
FIELD, ID, RERUN corresponding to a given objID.</p>

<p>For Python users, the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/sdsspy/">sdsspy</a> package
provides "sdsspy.util.objid()" and "sdsspy.util.photoid_extract()" to
convert RUN, CAMCOL, FIELD, ID, RERUN into objID and back,
respectively.
</p>

<p>In the CAS, there is a database function
<code>fObjIDFromSDSS()</code> which will convert RUN, CAMCOL, FIELD,
ID, RERUN into a properly formatted objID. The function
<code>fSDSSFromObjID()</code> will return the RUN, CAMCOL, FIELD, ID,
RERUN corresponding to a given objID.</p>

<dt id="photoz">photoZ</dt>

<dd>The photometric redshift. The measured colors of galaxies and quasars
are observed to depend on their redshift, as the spectral energy distribution
of the object moves through the filters.  This allows the redshift to be
estimated from the measured colors, in the absence of a spectrum. Photometric
redshifts have larger random and systematic errors than spectroscopic
redshifts, but they can be obtained for fainter and thus many more galaxies

<dt id="plate">Plate</dt>

<dd>Each spectroscopic exposure employs a large, thin, circular metal plate

<dt id="profile">Profile</dt>

<dd>
<p>An azimuthally-averaged radial surface brightness profile. In the

arcsec. The number of annuli for which there is a measurable signal is
listed as <code>nprof</code>, the mean surface brightness is listed as
<code>profMean</code>, and the error is listed as
<code>profErr</code>.  This error includes both photon noise, and the
small-scale 'bumpiness' in the counts as a function of azimuthal
angle.</p>

<p>When converting the <code>profMean</code> values to a local surface
brightness, it is <em>not</em> the best approach to assign the mean
surface brightness to some radius within the annulus and then linearly
interpolate between radial bins.  Do not use smoothing
splines, as they will not go through the points in the cumulative
profile and thus (obviously) will not conserve flux. What
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#frames_pipeline">frames pipeline</a>
does, <em>e.g.</em>, in determining the
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#mag_petro">Petrosian ratio</a>, is to fit a
taut spline to the <em>cumulative</em> profile and then differentiate
that spline fit, after transforming both the radii and cumulative profiles
with asinh functions.  We recommend doing the same here.</p>

<dt id="scanline">Scanline</dt>

<dd>A subdivision of a <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#strip">strip</a>. Each strip
is covered by 6 "scanlines".  Scanlines are defined in
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#great_circle_coords">great circle coordinates</a>.
The great circle coordinate system is different for each strip, and is defined
by setting the equator of the coordinate system to be the center line of
constant &eta; for the <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#stripe">stripe</a> to which the
strip belongs.  A scanline is then bounded on the top and bottom by
lines of constant <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#nu">&nu;</a>, with no east or
west boundaries. Scanlines touch but don't overlap, and thus are a unique
mapping on the sky for that stripe only.  Scanlines for different stripes
<em>do</em> overlap. This is because the scanlines come from the camera columns,
or <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#camcol">camcols</a>, which have a fixed physical
width, while the spherical coordinates converge at the poles.

any photometric enumeration system.  It needs to be cast as unsigned
64-bit, though in many files we waste a few bytes and write it as an
string to avoid FITS compliance issues.</p>

<p>The bits are assigned in SpecObjID as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>50-63</b>: plate id number (14 bits)</li>
<li> <b>38-49</b>: fiber id number (12 bits)</li>

<li> <b>10-23</b>: "run2d" rerun number of pipeline reduction (14 bits)</li>
<li> <b>0-9</b>: all 0 (10 bits)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that even though the effective "run2d" value for many plates
are the same as in DR7, this definition of specObjID is different than
that in DR7.</p>

<p><code>run2d</code> can be an integer, like 26, or a string of the
form 'vN_M_P', where N, M and P are integers, with the restriction
5&le;N&le;6, 0&le;M&le;99, and 0&le;P&le;99. This is understood to be the
<code>run2d</code> value for a spectrum. In the latter case, the 14
bits corresponding to <code>run2d</code> are filled with

A "stripe" is defined by a line of constant &eta;, bounded on the north and
south by the edges of the two strips that make up the stripe, and bounded on
the east and west by lines of constant &lambda;. Because both strips and
stripes are defined in "observed" space, they are rectangular areas

<dt id="stripe_82_coadd">Stripe 82 coadd</dt>

<dd>An SDSS data product that sums (<em>i.e.</em>, co-adds) individual pixels
from the photometric sections of runs on Stripe 82. There are two coadds: one
for the North strip and one for the South strip. These co-added runs were
processed via the photometric pipeline to produce catalog values for
objects that go much deeper than the individual runs. Thus "Stripe 82 coadd"
can also refer to the catalog values as well as to the pixels.  The coadd is
available through the DR7 CAS.</dd>

<dt id="stripe_82_database">Stripe 82 database</dt>

<dd>The Stripe 82 database, accessible via the DR7
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#CAS">CAS</a>, includes the Stripe 82 coadds
as well as all runs ever obtained on Stripe 82. Runs obtained earlier than
2004 were in photometric conditions and were part of the Southern Survey. More
recent runs were for the Supernova Survey and have a faster cadence, but were
often obtained in non-photometric conditions, or with Moon, or with poor
seeing. All of the runs have been calibrated in a uniform way, although the
non-photometric runs will of course have larger errors. The DR9 and DR10
releases do not separately distribute this data.</dd>

<dd>One of the three surveys that comprised the second phase
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#sdss2">(SDSS-II)</a>
of the <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#sdss">Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)</a>.
It featured repeated imaging of <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#stripe82">Stripe 82</a>
to find these remnants of gigantic explosions from dying stars, together with
detailed spectroscopic and photometric followup to get redshifts and
lightcurves.  The survey discovered almost 500 confirmed Type 1a
supernovae with redshifts up to about 0.4.  Their light curves allow
determination of their distances, making them useful to map the rate of
expansion of the universe, and thus
quantify the properties of cosmological dark energy.</dd>

<dt id="surface_brightness">Surface Brightness</dt>

<dd>
<p>The <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#frames_pipeline">frames pipeline</a> also

<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#mag_petro">Petrosian flux</a> for
each band, <code>petroR50</code> and <code>petroR90</code> respectively.
The usual characterization of surface-brightness in the target selection
pipeline of the SDSS is the mean surface brightness within petroR50.</p>

<p>It turns out that the ratio of petroR50 to petroR90, the so-called
"inverse concentration index", is correlated with morphology
(Shimasaku et al. 2001, Strateva et al. 2001). Galaxies with a
de&nbsp;Vaucouleurs profile have an inverse concentration index of around
0.3; exponential galaxies have an inverse concentration index of around 0.43.
Thus, this parameter can be used as a simple morphological classifier.</p>

<p>An important caveat when using these quantities is that they are not
corrected for seeing. This causes the surface brightness to be underestimated,
and the inverse concentration index to be overestimated, for objects of size
comparable to the PSF.</p>

<dt id="surveybest">Survey Best</dt>

<dd>The best imaging observation of an object with multiple

However, occasionally there are objects detected in areas which are

<dt id="survey_coords">Survey Coordinates</dt>

<dd>One of the main coordinate systems used by the

where (&eta;,&lambda;)=(0,90.) corresponds to (ra,dec)=(275.,0.) and (&eta;,&lambda;)=(57.5,0.)
corresponds to (ra,dec)=(0.,90.). Note also that at (&eta;, &lambda;)=(0.,0.),
(ra,dec)=(185.,32.5). So, this is a pure rotation of the usual RA/Dec system,
as opposed to the <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#great_circle_coords">great circle system</a>,
which is defined relative to each individual <a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#stripe">stripe</a>.
For some reason, although "&eta;" is constant along great
circles, it is referred to as "survey latitude," while "&lambda;" is referred to
 as "survey longitude." Also, "&eta; runs only from -90. to 90.; the back of
the sphere is covered by "&lambda;", which runs from -180. to 180. The Survey
coordinates are defined such that the "primary" area of a
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#stripe">stripe</a> (otherwise known as a
<a href="drXX/help/glossary.php#stave">stave</a>) in the north
is defined by a rectangle in Survey coordinates which is 2.5 degrees wide in
