The 2.5-meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory, named the
Sloan Foundation Telescope in recognition of the pivotal and generous
support of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation through all phases of
the SDSS.  All SDSS imaging and spectroscopy were carried out
with the Sloan Telescope, equipped with a large format digital
camera and fiber-fed spectrographs that measured spectra of 640
objects at a time.  These facilities, together with some new
instruments, are also being used for SDSS-III.
