<h2>About the SDSS</h2>

<li id="whatissdss">
<h3>What is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>

<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is an ongoing astronomy project that has been working since 1998
to make a detailed map of the universe, including our Milky Way galaxy. Since 2008, the survey
has been in operating its third phase. Results and from the first two phases are available at
<a href="http://www.sdss.org">www.sdss.org</a>. Results and data from the current (third) phase are
available on this website, <a href="index.php">www.sdss3.org</a>.</p>
</li>

<li id="whythethree">
<h3>What is SDSS-III? Why the "three"? <a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>

<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has been funded to operate in three phases. Phase one, from
1998 to 2005, was the original <a href="http://www.sdss.org">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a>.</p>

<p>Phase two, from 2005 to 2008, was the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II), which consisted
of three interrelated surveys. The <a href="http://www.sdss.org/legacy/index.html">SDSS
Legacy Survey</a> completed observations on the full coverage area of the SDSS as originally
planned. The SDSS-II <a href="http://www.sdss.org/supernova/aboutsupernova.html">Supernova
Survey</a> scanned the same area of sky each clear night for three years, and found
hundreds of type Ia supernovae. The SDSS-II <a href="http://www.sdss.org/segue/">SEGUE</a>
survey (Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration) mapped the
structure and composition of the Milky way.</p>

<p>Phase three, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), is the current phase of operations.
This website, accessible from the <a href="index.php">SDSS-III home page</a>, describes
SDSS-III, its <a href="surveys/">four component surveys</a>, and its
<a href="science/">science results</a>. This site also includes data collected by the
SDSS-III. The latest data is <a href="dr10/">Data Release 10</a>, made public on July 30, 2013.</p>
</li>

<li id="data">
<h3>What data does SDSS have? What can SDSS tell me about the sky? <a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>

<p>The most recent SDSS data release, the ninth overall, is <a href="dr10/">SDSS Data Release
10 (DR10)</a>, made public on July 31, 2012. It includes most data from prior data releases; so to get the most recent,
up-to-date data for anywhere in the sky, use <a href="dr10/">Data Release 10</a>.</p>

<p>Data Release 10 includes <a href="dr10/imaging/">imaging data</a> for about one-third of the
night sky. The imaging data include images from the camera on the SDSS's 2.5-meter telescope as
preview images (JPGs) and as FITS files. The data also include
catalogs of detected objects, with parameters
measured from imaging, including positions and magnitudes. DR10 also includes
<a href="dr10/spectro/">spectroscopic data</a> for more than three million
stars, galaxies, and quasars, Spectra are available as preview images (PNGs) and FITS files.
Spectroscopic catalog data include object types and redshifts.</p>

<p>All DR10 data are available from this site. See <a href="dr10/data_access/">DR10 Data Access</a>
to learn how to view and download DR10 data.</p>

<p>Prior SDSS-III data releases are also available on this site.
<a href="dr9/">Data Release 9 (DR9)</a> was made public on July 31, 2012.
<a href="dr8/">Data Release 8 (DR8)</a> was made public on January 11, 2011.</p>

<p>The final data release for SDSS-I and SDSS-II is <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr7">Data
Release 7</a>.</p>

<li id="learn">
<h3>I am a teacher. How can I use the data in my classes?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>

<p>The <a href="education/">SDSS-III Education</a> page describes what educational
resources are available from the SDSS-III project.</p>

<p>The SDSS-III SkyServer website includes a variety of
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/proj/">educational projects</a> that
use SDSS data to teach topics in astronomy and other sciences,
using guided and open inquiry. With our Projects, you and your students can
learn about spectra and
colors of stars, galaxy types, the history of the universe, and much more.</p>

<p>You are welcome to use and adapt any of our projects in your classes, free of charge. For more
information on what you can do with SkyServer in the classroom, see our
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/proj/teach.aspx">Teacher FAQ</a>.</p>

<li id="brightstars">
<h3>Why doesn't the SDSS have data for well-known visible stars (Sirius,
Vega, etc.)?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>The SDSS has a very sensitive <a href="instruments/camera.php">camera</a>.
Stars that you can see with your unaided eyes are a too bright for the
SDSS's camera; they are saturated, and the light from them spills all
over the detector. The SDSS still gets an image of
those stars (for example, here is an image of <a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/tools/chart/navi.aspx?ra=116.2997&amp;dec=28&amp;scale=10">Pollux</a> from SkyServer),
but the image processing software is unable to handle these images,
and there are no entries in the SDSS catalog.</p>
</li>

<li id="stargalaxy">
<h3>Why are some bright stars classified as galaxies?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>The SDSS distinguishes between stars and galaxies based on their shapes: single points of light are stars, and
fuzzy patches of light are galaxies. Some stars are bright enough that
their light saturates the camera, and thus the light spills over the image, so
to the SDSS's camera, they look like fuzzy disks instead of single points of light. Their appearance fools the
SDSS's software into classifying them as galaxies.</p>

<li id="whathelp">
<h3>What help is available for DR10?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>Apart from this page there is
a <a href="dr10/help/glossary.php">Glossary of SDSS-III terms</a>.
Each SkyServer tool also has its own Help section.

<li id="images">
<h3>What is the sky coverage of DR10? Where in the sky do DR10 data
come from?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>

<p>The SDSS takes imaging data in long, narrow "stripes", 2.5 degrees
wide.  Part of the processing of
SDSS images is to select some objects as targets for follow-up spectroscopy. The SDSS
then collects spectra later. Most spectra were collected using the original
<a href="instruments/segue2_spectrograph.php">SDSS-I/-II spectrograph</a>. DR10
includes data collected using the
<a href="instruments/boss_spectrograph.php">BOSS spectrograph</a> and for the
								 first time, data collected using the
<a href="instruments/apogee_spectrograph.php">APOGEE spectrograph</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="dr10/scope.php">Scope of DR10</a> page shows what areas of sky (sky coverage)
are included in DR10. The Scope page also includes a Coverage Check form that allows
you to see what data DR10 has for a given point on the sky.</p>
</li>


<li id="findobj">
<h3>How can I see if DR10 has an image or spectrum of my favorite sky
object?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>

<p>Go to the SkyServer <a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/tools/chart/navi.aspx">
Navigate</a> tool. Enter the name of your object in the "Name" box, then press Enter.
The RA/dec coordinates of the object will appear in the boxes below. Then, click Get Image.</p>

<p>If a sky image appears in the main Navigate frame, then DR10 has an image for your object.</p>

<p>If there is an image for your object, you can also check to see whether DR10 includes a
spectrum. Under the RA/Dec boxes, find the <span class="term">Drawing options</span>.
Click the checkbox next to <span class="term">Objects with spectra</span>. If a red square
appears around your object, then your object has a measured spectrum in DR10.</p>

<p>Whether or not your object has a spectrum in DR10, the object's magnitude data will appear
in the right-hand pane. Click <span class="term">Quick Look</span> to go see additional
basic data about that object. Click <span class="term">Explore</span> for more detailed data.</p>
</li>

<li id="searchtools">
<h3>How can I search for data?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>When you search for data in the SDSS, you are going through the SDSS
database and looking for objects that match criteria you
choose. For simple searches of photometric data, use the
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/tools/search/iqs.aspx">Imaging Query Form</a>.
For simple searches of spectroscopic data, use the
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/tools/search/sqs.aspx">Spectroscopic Query Form</a>.
For more complex searches,  use Structured Query Language (SQL). See SkyServer's
guide on <a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/help/howto/search/">Searching for Data</a>
to learn more about SQL. To see thumbnail results of objects that meet your
criteria, use the <a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/tools/chart/list.aspx">Image List</a> tool.</p>

<p>For large, complex queries that will take a long time to run, use
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/casjobs/">CasJobs</a>,
the SDSS's batch query interface.</p>

<p>Many other search tools are available. See the <a href="dr10/data_access/">DR10 Data Access</a>
pages for more options.</p>

<p>An important note if you are using Excel with the
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/proj">SkyServer educational projects</a>: SDSS
object IDs are so long that they get cut off in Excel, and show up with 000 as the last
three digits. This means you won't be able to find your objects anymore! To get around
this problem, see this <a
href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/help/howto/graph/caveat.aspx">workaround</a>. </p>
</li>


<li id="crossmatch">
<h3>How can I match a list of objects to see what data are available for them in DR10?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>

<p>
If you have a fairly small list of objects to match - a few hundred or so - use the
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/tools/crossid/">SkyServer Cross-ID</a>
tool. Paste your list of objects, or upload a file containing data with the last two
columns as (ra, dec) in decimal degrees. Click Submit. The next page will show only those
objects that appear in the SDSS, with SDSS Object IDs that
link to the <a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/tools/explore/obj.aspx">Explore</a> tool.</p>

<p>To see a thumbnail SDSS image of each matching object, use the <a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/tools/chart/list.aspx">Image List</a> tool. Enter
your list in the textbox on the upper left and click "Get Image". Click on one of the thumbnails to go to that position in the
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/tools/chart/navi.aspx">Navigate</a> tool, or on one of the object names to go to that object's
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/tools/explore/obj.aspx">Explore</a> tool entry.</p>

<p>
For longer lists, use the Neighbors Search feature of
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/casjobs/">CasJobs</a>. See the
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/casjobs/faq.aspx#crossid">CasJobs FAQ entry</a> on "How can I cross-identify
(find matching objects in SDSS) for my list of sources for which I have RA,decs?" for more information.

<h3>What is the difference between <code>SpecObj</code> and <code>SpecObjAll</code>? What
do <code>sciencePrimary</code> and <code>bossPrimary</code> mean?
&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>

<p>The <code>SpecObjAll</code> table contains <span class="term">all</span> spectroscopic
objects, even duplicate spectra of the same object. Thus, we have
created the <code>SpecObj</code> view, which contains data for <span class="term">only</span>
those fibers defined as <span class="term">sciencePrimary</span> - essentially, the best
spectrum that the SDSS has obtained for that object. That is, <code>specObj</code>
contains no duplicate observations.</p>

<p>Similar to <code>sciencePrimary</code>, another parameter called <code>bossPrimary</code>
flags the best spectrum that BOSS has obtained for an object. Exact definitions of
<code>sciencePrimary</code> and <code>bossPrimary</code> can be found in the
<a href="dr10/spectro/catalogs.php">spectroscopic catalogs</a> documentation.</p>

</li>

<li id="photoobjtag">
<h3>What are the differences between <code>PhotoObj</code>, <code>PhotoTag</code>,
and <code>PhotoObjAll</code>?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>

<p><code>PhotoObjAll</code> is a table that contains
<span class="term">all</span> of the measured photometric quantities for
<span class="term">all</span> of the imaging detections for every object.
Because we measure hundreds of parameters for each of 1.2 billion detections, this is a
very large table, and queries can take very long to run. Also,
<code>PhotoObjAll</code> includes duplicate and "special" detections such as <a
href="dr10/help/glossary.php#parent">parent</a> or <a
href="dr10/help/glossary.php#bright">bright</a> detections, which are normally not of
interest to science users.</p>

<p>In an effort to speed up catalog data queries, we have created
<code>PhotoTag</code>, a view (virtual or logical table) of PhotoObjAll
with only a subset of the photometric parameters that are
most often requested. Queries on this "thin" version of PhotoObjAll run
much faster usually than queries on the larger table. If you have a
query that uses and returns only values stored in <code>PhotoTag</code>,
then you should definitely use <code>PhotoTag</code>.</p>

<p>In addition, we have created <code>PhotoObj</code>, a view of
<code>PhotoObjAll</code> that contains only those objects that are <a
href="dr10/help/glossary.php#surveyprimary">survey primary</a> or <a
href="dr10/help/glossary.php#surveysecondary">survey secondary</a>.
<code>PhotoObj</code> excludes special objects such as
<a href="dr10/help/glossary.php#parent">parent</a> or <a
href="dr10/help/glossary.php#bright">bright</a> detections. Because
<code>PhotoObj</code> contains the same parameters as
<code>PhotoObjAll</code> but effectively contains fewer objects,
any queries for survey primary or survey secondary objects will run
faster on <code>PhotoObj</code>.</p>


<p>Finally, there is <code>PhotoPrimary</code>, a view of
<code>PhotoObjAll</code> that only includes
<a href="dr10/help/glossary.php#surveyprimary">survey primary</a> detections;
if you are not interested in duplicate detections at all, this is the
view to use.</p>

To summarize, the <code>PhotoTag</code> view is a vertical partition of
<code>PhotoObjAll</code> (fewer columns), and <code>PhotoObj</code>,
<code>PhotoPrimary</code> and <code>PhotoSecondary</code> are horizontal
partitions of <code>PhotoObjAll</code> (fewer rows).

<p>Given the above, you should consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>Querying from <code>PhotoTag</code> if it contains all the parameters you are using
to search and all the parameters you want returned</li>
<li>Querying from <code>PhotoObj</code> otherwise, UNLESS you are interested in data
for objects that are <span class="term">neither PRIMARY nor SECONDARY</span>. In that
case, you will need to use the full <code>PhotoObjAll</code> table.</li>
<li>Importantly, the "shorthand" quantities <span class="term">u,g,r,i,z</span> do
<span class="term">not</span> exist in <code>PhotoTag</code> (because we want to
keep the view as thin as possible). Instead, you must use the
<span class="term">modelMag_[ugriz]</span> columns. HOWEVER, in
<code>PhotoObjAll</code> and its views, only the <span
class="term">u,g,r,i,z</span> are indexed, and NOT the ModelMags! This
difference in indexed columns is to save space (since indexes on a huge
table like <code>PhotoObjAll</code> are expensive), not to confuse you!</li>
</ol>

<p>Because <code>PhotoTag</code> has many fewer parameters, larger portions of it
can be cached, improving performance. We have found that for almost
all queries that contain parameters fully in <code>PhotoTag</code>, it is
faster. </p>

<li id="specphotoall">

<h3>How do I get photometry for spectroscopic objects? What are the <code>SpecPhotoAll</code>
table and <code>SpecPhoto</code> view?
&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>

<p>The <em>SpecPhotoAll</em> table is a precomputed join between the
<em>PhotoObjAll</em> and
<em>SpecObjAll</em> tables. It includes the most requested parameters
from these two tables. Because the join has already been performed, it
can be faster than computing the join on the fly. The
<code>SpecPhoto</code> view contains the same parameters as <code>SpecPhotoAll</code>,
but only for objects that are <a href="dr10/help/glossary.php#surveyprimary">survey
primary</a> or <a href="dr10/help/glossary.php#surveysecondary">survey secondary</a>.</p>

</li>

<li id="numprec">
<h3>Why do some values (such as <code>z</code> and <code>zErr</code> in <code>SpecObj</code>)
have different numerical precisions?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>Internally, these numbers are stored to their full precision as they come out
of the spectroscopic pipeline. When you perform a query, they have some
default string format applied that cuts them to what you see.</p>

<p>But you can use SQL's <code>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa259237%28v=sql.80%29.aspx">str()<img src="images/offsite.png" alt=" (offsite)" /></a> </code>
function to change the string format to whatever you like.</p>

<p>To get z to 6 decimals, for example, change your query to search for
<code>select str(z,8,6) as z</code> instead of just <code>z</code>, and analogously
for <code>zErr</code>. This applies the function <code>str()</code>
to the values in column <code>z</code> and returns the result with column label
<code>z</code> (without the "as", the result of a function has no column label). The function
<code>str(col,length,dec)</code> takes the numerical value in <code>col</code> and formats
it as a string of length <i>length</i> and with <i>dec</i> significant digits. In other words,
<code>str(z,8,6)</code> is the SQL equivalent to the C function
<code>printf("%8.6f",z)</code>. The <code>str()</code> function rounds the

<h3>What is the difference between <em>class</em> and <em>type</em> for spectroscopic objects, and which one should I use?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>

<p>For any object in DR10, the <code>type</code> parameter in <code>SpecObj</code> and other
tables was set when that object was <span class="term">targeted</span>
for spectroscopy (i.e., it is based on its morphology in the imaging data).
The <code>class</code> parameter is set by the spectroscopic pipeline
<span class="term">after</span> the spectrum is observed (i.e., it is
based on features in the spectrum).</p>

<p>In nearly all cases, you should believe the classification in <code>class</code>, since it
tells you what the measured spectrum actually was. The <code>type</code> field tells you about
why it was targeted. (However, there is more information about the object's target selection
history in the target bits; see the <a href="dr10/algorithms/bitmasks.php">target bitmasks</a>
pages for more information.</p>

<h3>Why can't I log in to CasJobs?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>

<p>There are actually two CasJobs sites. <a href="http://casjobs.sdss.org/casjobs">SDSS-I/-II
CasJobs</a> hosts data from the original SDSS-I and SDSS-II, up through Data Release 7.
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/casjobs/">SDSS-III CasJobs</a> hosts data from
Data Releases 8 and 9.
If you have a login on SDSS-I/-II CasJobs, you will need to
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/casjobs/CreateAccount.aspx">create a new account on
SDSS-III CasJobs</a> to work with SDSS-III data.</p>

<p>CasJobs uses the idea of query <span class="term">contexts</span>, allowing you to
specify what data sources you can query. The default context is to search your
<span class="term">MyDB</span> personal database space. To search DR10, the context should
be set to <span class="term">DR10</span>. You can choose from the Context drop-down menu above
the area where you run queries. Before you run a CasJobs query, check what context you are
searching. See the <a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/casjobs/Guide.aspx">CasJobs user guide</a>

<h3>What is the Catalog Archive Server (CAS)? What is the Science Archive Server (SAS)?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>
The SDSS-III data can be accessed in two ways. It can be viewed as catalog data (such as redshifts, metallicity, etc.) or
as FITS images and data files. Catalog data, along with preview images
and spectra, are available from the <a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/">Catalog Archive Server</a>.
FITS images and data are available from the <a href="http://data.sdss3.org">Science Archive Server</a>.
For specific detail on how to access the data
please refer to <a href="dr10/imaging/imaging_access.php">this page</a>
for the imaging data and <a href="dr10/spectro/spectro_access.php">this page</a>
for the spectroscopic data.</p>

<h3>What is SkyServer?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>

<a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org">SkyServer</a> is a web site where
professional astronomers, students and members of the general public
can get data from the SDSS.  SkyServer's <a
href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/proj/">Projects</a> are excellent
resources for astronomy educators who want to include real data in
their courses.</p> </li>

<li id="longID">
<h3>What does the long SDSS ID number mean, and how do I work with it?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>The SDSS needs a way to uniquely identify every object in the database, so it generates ID numbers. The ID numbers are code numbers that
include information about how the object was observed.</p>

<p>One very important point when working with SkyServer is that the object IDs are so long that they get cut off in Excel, and show up with
000 as the last three digits. This means you won't be able to find your objects anymore! To get around this problem, see this
<a
href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/help/howto/graph/caveat.aspx">workaround</a>. </p>

<li id="longID2">
<h3>Why does SDSS use the long (64-bit) objID fields, and what is the composition of the PhotoObj <em>objID</em> and SpecObj <em>specObjID</em> fields?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>The 64-bit ID fields are required as primary keys (unique identifiers) in the SDSS database tables.  They are used to uniquely identify
each record in the <a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/help/docs/intro.asp#indices">database indices</a> for enhanced
performance.  Each of them are bit-encoded with information about the observational origin, i.e., the run,rerun, camera column, etc. for
photometric data, and the plate, MJD, fiberID etc. for spectroscopic
objects. See the glossary for exactly how <a
href="dr10/help/glossary.php#ObjID">objid</a> and <a
href="dr10/help/glossary.php#specobj">specobjid</a> are defined.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between <em>SpecPhoto</em> and <em>SpecPhotoAll</em>?&nbsp;<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#Top"><small>Top</small></a></h3>

<p>The <em>SpecPhoto</em> view includes only those pairs where the
SpecObj is a sciencePrimary (<a href="dr10/help/faq.php#scienceprimary">see the

<li id="str"> <h3>How do I change the default precision of values in
the output of my query?&nbsp;<a

<b>str(<i>column</i>,<i>n</i>,<i>d</i>)</b> SQL construct (where
<i>n</i> is the total number of digits and <i>d</i> is the number of
decimal places) to set the precision of the column that your query
requests.  SkyServer returns values with a default precision that is
set for each data type, and this may not be enough precision for some
types of science. See the sample query "<a
