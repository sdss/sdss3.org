<p>While SDSS-III does not have a dedicated supernova observing program, supernova data from a previous incarnation of SDSS (SDSS-II) are still available. SDSS-II, which ran from 2005 to 2008,  included a Supernova Survey, described in detail at the 
<a href="http://www.sdss.org/supernova/aboutsupernova.html">Supernova Survey</a> section 
of the original SDSS website.</p>

<p>Data available from that site include a list of <a href="http://www.sdss.org/supernova/snlist_confirmed.html">spectroscopically confirmed 
supernovae</a>, supernova  
<a href="http://www.sdss.org/supernova/lightcurves.html">lightcurves</a>, and a link to a <a href="http://sdssdp62.fnal.gov/sdsssn/SNANA-PUBLIC/">supernova analysis package</a> that 
SDSS-II used. The raw images taken by the Sloan Foundation Telescope as part of the 
SDSS Supernova Survey are available as JPG preview images from the 
<a href="http://cas.sdss.org/stripe82/en/tools/getimg/fields.asp">Stripe 82 Catalog 
Archive Server (CAS) Get Images tool</a>, and as FITS files from the 
<a href="http://das.sdss.org/www/html/">SDSS Data Archive Server</a>.</p>
