<h2>Get supernova data?</h2>



<p>

   At the moment, the easiest way to get the supernovae observed with SDSS 
would be to go to the original <a href="http://www.sdss.org/supernova/aboutsupernova.html">SDSS
   web site</a> that provides a general description of the SDSS 
   Supernova Survey (which was part of SDSS-II, and ran between 2005 and 2008),
as well as a list of <a href="http://www.sdss.org/supernova/snlist_confirmed.html">spectroscopically
   confirmed SNe</a>,    
   <a href="http://www.sdss.org/supernova/lightcurves.html">lightcurves</a>,
and a link to a <a href="http://sdssdp62.fnal.gov/sdsssn/SNANA-PUBLIC/">supernova
   analysis package</a>.
