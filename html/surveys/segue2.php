<p>The original Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding
and Exploration (SEGUE-1) obtained spectra of nearly
230,000 unique stars over a range of spectral types to investigate Milky Way 
structure. Building on this success,
  SEGUE-2 spectroscopically observed around 119,000 unique stars,
focusing on the <i>in situ</i> stellar halo of the Galaxy,
from distances of 10 to 60 kpc. </p>

<p>The complete spectral sample 
from SEGUE-1 and SEGUE-2 was available for SDSS-III DR8. Data 
Release 9 presented an updated version of the <a href="dr10/spectro/sspp.php">SEGUE Stellar 
Parameter Pipeline</a>. It also included new <a href="dr10/data_access/vac.php">Value-Added 
Catalogs</a>. 
There have been no updates to SEGUE data or processing for DR10.

<p>Combining SEGUE-1 and 2 reveals the complex kinematic and chemical substructure of
the Galactic halo and disks, providing essential clues to the assembly
and enrichment history of the Galaxy. In particular, the outer halo
is expected to be dominated by late-time accretion events.
SEGUE can help constrain existing models for the formation of the stellar halo
and inform the next generation of high resolution simulations of Galaxy
formation. In addition, SEGUE-1 and SEGUE-2 help uncover rare,
chemically primitive stars that are fossils of the earliest
generations of cosmic star formation. There have already been many different <a
href="science/segue_publications.php">science results</a> from SEGUE
data and many more to come. </p>

<p>Below we briefly discuss the aims of SEGUE-2 and SEGUE-1. If you would like to

 <h2>SEGUE-2: Mapping the Outer Milky Way</h2> 

<p>Much of what we know about the stellar halo comes from
kinematically-selected stars in the solar neighborhood. In any
cosmological scenario we expect the stellar halo to form inside out,
with the outer halo increasingly dominated by recent
accretion. SEGUE-2 capitalizes on the wide field and high throughput
of SDSS instruments to focus on the more distant halo with the goal of
understanding the growth of our stellar halo over time. Specific
questions we hope can be addressed with the SEGUE-2 data include the
fraction of the halo formed by the accretion of dwarf galaxies
vs. <i>in situ</i> star formation, the accretion history of the halo
through time, and whether the chemical abundance distribution of the
more recently accreted, dynamically younger halo resembles the
surviving dwarf galaxies, such that the differences between these
dwarf galaxies and the halo observed in the solar neighborhood result from 
different accretion times. In addition, finding more halo stars is the most 
likely way to increase the number of tracers in the Galactic gravitational 
potential at large distances in order to better determine the total mass of the 
Galaxy.</p> 

<p>To probe the extremes of the halo stellar population distribution, SEGUE-2
specifically targets blue horizontal branch stars, K-giants, and M-giants.
Many important and rare halo tracers are impossible to survey <i>in situ</i>. Thus,
those three stellar categories are complemented
by a collection of main sequence turn off stars that cover a broad enough color
range to include metallicities up to solar and is neither biased in metallicity or
kinematics. </p>

<p>Additional local samples are used by SEGUE-2 to supplement the distant halo survey.
Old, cool white dwarfs can be assigned ages from models in order to date Galactic field
populations, as had been done with ultra-cool white dwarfs found in SDSS and SEGUE-1. Extreme
and ultra-cool subdwarfs explore the low-mass end of the halo mass function and
are sufficiently local to have good 3D kinematics. The cool subdwarfs
and the extremely metal-poor star sample in particular will also be useful
for studies of chemical evolution, nucleosynthesis, and stellar atmospheres.
Finally, SEGUE-2 investigates halo high velocity stars and hypervelocity stars.
</p>

<p>In selecting distant and rare objects, SEGUE-2 benefits from the
experience of SEGUE-1 in developing optimized and efficient selection
techniques. The SEGUE-2 selection methodology uses the most up to date
color and proper motion cuts with SDSS DR7 photometry and astrometry
to target particular spectral types. Additionally, the magnitude
limits for SEGUE-2 use SEGUE-1 as a test case to achieve the optimal
balance between survey depth, sky coverage, and data quality. Whereas
SEGUE-1 matched shorter exposures of bright targets with long
exposures of faint targets, SEGUE-2 obtains only deep pointings, as it
focuses on the far reaches of our Galaxy. </p>

<h2 id="SEGUE-1">SEGUE-1: Exploring Milky Way Structure</h2>

<p>The SEGUE-2 survey builds off of the work of SEGUE-1. For a thorough
overview of SEGUE-1, see <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AJ....137.4377Y">Yanny et
al. 2009</a>. To learn more about the differences between SEGUE-1 and
SEGUE-2, please go to the <a
href="dr10/tutorials/segue_getting_started.php#segue1_vs_segue2">Getting
Started</a> page.</p>

<p>SEGUE-1 was designed to explore the Milky Way structure; formation
history; kinematics; dynamical evolution; chemical evolution; and dark
matter distribution. The images and spectra obtained by SEGUE-1
allowed astronomers to map the positions and velocities of hundreds of
thousands of stars, from faint, relatively near-by (within about 100
pc or roughly 300 light-years) ancient stellar embers known as white
dwarfs to bright stellar giants located in the outer reaches of the
stellar halo, more than 100,000 light-years away. Encoded within the
spectral data are the composition and temperature of these stars,
vital clues for determining the age and origin of different
populations of stars within the Galaxy. </p>

<p> The primary goal of SEGUE-1 is a kinematic and stellar population
study of the high-latitude thick disk and halo of the Milky Way.  The
halo is sampled sparsely with a series of seven deg<sup>2</sup> tiles
both in the SEGUE-1 imaging stripes and the main Legacy survey area,
with centers separated by roughly 10 deg.  Each such tile is sampled
with two pointings, split at r=17.8, approximately the median target
magnitude. </p>

<p> Half of the targets on each line of sight are devoted to sampling
across various main sequence types, up to and including the main
sequence turnoff. These are largely selected for spectroscopic follow
up based on straightforward color-color and color-magnitude cuts. To
this sample we add metal-poor main sequence turnoff stars selected by
their blue <i>ugr</i> colors. These targets tend to be at a
heliocentric distance of 10 kpc for [Fe/H] = -1.54.  To reach to
greater distances, SEGUE-1 samples field blue horizontal branch (BHB)
stars, which extends to distances of approximately 40 kpc. Also
reaching this distance is the sample of halo red giants. </p>

<p> The spectroscopic selection also includes smaller categories of
rare but interesting objects.  These include cool white dwarfs, which
can be used to date the age of the Galactic disk, and high proper
motion targets from the SUPERBLINK catalog, which have uncovered some
of the most extreme M subdwarfs known and aided in the calibration of
their metallicity scale using common proper motion pairs.</p>
