<p>The Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS) will monitor the radial velocities of 11,000 bright stars, with the precision and cadence needed to detect gas giant planets that have orbital periods ranging from several hours to two years.</p>

<p>With well-characterized sensitivity and a broad range of target star properties,
MARVELS will provide a critical dataset for testing theoretical models of the formation,
migration, and dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. It will have unique sensitivity
to rare systems such as extreme eccentricity planets or objects in the "brown dwarf desert."</p>
