<h2>Astronomers identify the stellar patrons of the Milky Way bar</h2>

<p>Forget the restaurant at the end of the Universe &mdash; astronomers now have the clearest
understanding yet of the bar at the center of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>Scientists with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) have announced the discovery
of hundreds of stars rapidly moving together in long, looping orbits around the center of
our Galaxy. "The best explanation for their orbits is that these stars are part of the
Milky Way bar," says David Nidever, a Dean B. McLaughin Fellow in the Astronomy Department
at the University of Michigan. "We know that the bar plays an important role in
determining the structure of the Galaxy, so learning more about these stars will help us
understand the whole Galaxy, even out here in the spiral arms."</p>

The team's discovery came from accurately measuring the speeds of thousands of stars
near the center of the Milky Way. The center of our Galaxy is 30,000 light-years away &mdash; close
by cosmic standards &mdash; yet we know surprisingly little about it, because the Galaxy's
dusty disk hides it from view. In spite of this blind spot, though, we do know a key fact
about our Galaxy: like many spiral galaxies, the Milky Way has a 'bar' of stars that orbit
together around the Galactic Center.
</p>


<p>
"We know of the bar's existence from many separate lines of evidence," says Gail Zasowski,
a National Science Foundation postdoctoral Fellow at The Ohio State University. "What we
don't know is which stars are part of the bar, and what the velocities of those stars are.
That information will help us understand how the bar formed, and how its stars relate to
the stars in the rest of the Galaxy."
</p>

<p>
The trouble is that there is no obvious way to tell a star in the Milky Way's bar apart
from any other star in the same neighborhood. Instead, the key to finding bar stars is to
measure the velocities of many stars, then see whether some of those stars are moving
together in some unusual pattern. Although interstellar dust blocks nearly all visible
light, longer infrared wavelengths can partially shine through. So a survey of stellar
positions and velocities that operates in infrared light could finally pierce the veil of
dust, and collect data from enough stars in the innermost Milky Way to firmly identify
which ones are part of the bar.
</p>

<p>
Enter SDSS-III's new Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). APOGEE uses a
custom-built high-resolution infrared spectrograph attached to the 2.5-meter Sloan
Foundation Telescope in New Mexico, and is capable of measuring the velocities and
chemical compositions of up to 300 stars at once. "What separates APOGEE from previous
spectroscopic surveys is that we are studying the Galaxy using infrared light," Nidever
says. APOGEE began observations in June 2011 and has already observed more than 48,000
stars all over our galaxy.
</p>


<p>
In a paper published recently in the <i>Astrophysical Journal</i>, a worldwide team of
scientists including Nidever and Zasowski used data from the first few months of APOGEE
observations to measure the velocities for nearly 5,000 stars near the Galactic center.
With these velocity measurements, they assembled a picture of how these stars orbit the
center of the Milky Way. However, quite unexpectedly, they found that a substantial
fraction of stars in the inner Galaxy are moving away from us quickly &mdash; about 10 percent
of the total stars in their sample are moving at more than 200 kilometers per second
(400,000 miles per hour) away from the Earth. The observed pattern of these fast stars is
similar in many different parts of the inner Galaxy, and is the same above and below the
midplane of the Galaxy &mdash; suggesting that these measurements of fast central stars are not
just a statistical fluke, but really are a feature of our Galaxy.

The team then compared their observations with the predictions of the bar stars from the
latest computer models of the Galaxy &mdash; and the observations matched the predictions
closely. "Based on the evidence from the model comparisons, I am now confident that these
fast-moving stars are part of the bar," Nidever says. "I was actually quite surprised that
they showed up so clearly in our survey.
</p>

<p>
APOGEE's identification of which stars are part of the bar will allow astronomers to study
how stars in the bar and in the rest of the galaxy react to one another. "The bar acts
like a giant mixer for our galaxy," says Steven Majewski, a professor of astronomy at the
University of Virginia and the principal investigator for the APOGEE project. "As the bar
rotates, it churns up the motions of nearby stars. Over time, this mixing should have a
large effect on the disk of our galaxy, including in spiral arms where we live, but this
effect is not well understood. This new sample of definitively-identified bar stars gives
us a unique opportunity to learn more about exactly how this giant blender mixes up our
galaxy."
</p>

<p>
But the team's discovery only tells half the story. So far, APOGEE has only observed one
side of the bar, the side where the stars are moving away from the Earth. On the other
side, the stars must be moving toward Earth. But unfortunately, the Sloan telescope is
inconveniently placed: the other half of the Milky Way bar is visible only from Earth's
southern hemisphere. Seeing the other side of the bar is one of the motivations for a
planned fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  Part of this successor project
will implement the same techniques using a 2.5-meter telescope in Chile to observe the
rest of the inner Milky Way. The new survey is set to begin in 2014.
