<p>When it comes to our galaxy, home is where the star is.</p>

<p>Scientists with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) have created a new map 
of the Milky Way and determined that 30 percent of stars have dramatically 
changed their orbits. This discovery, published in yesterday's issue of 
<em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>, brings a new understanding of how stars 
are formed, and how they travel throughout our galaxy.</p>

<p>"In our modern world, many people move far away from their birthplaces, 
sometimes halfway around the world," says Michael Hayden of New Mexico 
State University (NMSU), the lead author of the new study. "Now we're 
finding the same is true of stars in our galaxy &mdash; about 30 percent 
of the stars in our Galaxy have traveled a long way from the orbits in 
which they were born."</p>

<p>To build a map of the Milky Way, the scientists used the SDSS Apache 
Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Explorer (APOGEE) spectrograph to 
observe 146,000 stars during a 3-year campaign.</p>

<p>The key to creating and interpreting this map is measuring the elements 
in the atmosphere of each star. "From the chemical composition of a star, 
we can learn its ancestry and life history," Hayden says.</p>

<p>The chemical information comes from spectra, which are detailed measurements 
of how much light the star gives off at different wavelengths. Spectra show 
prominent lines that correspond to elements and molecules present. Reading 
the spectral lines of a star can tell astronomers what the star is made of.</p>

<p>"Stellar spectra show us that the chemical makeup of our galaxy is constantly 
changing," says Jon Holtzman, an astronomer at NMSU who was involved in the study. 
"Stars create heavier elements in their cores, and when the stars die, those 
heavier elements go back into the gas from which the next stars form."</p>

<p>As a result of this process of "chemical enrichment," each generation of 
stars has a higher percentage of heavier elements than the previous generation 
did. In some regions of the Galaxy, star formation has proceeded more vigorously 
than in other regions -- and in these more vigorous regions, more generations 
of stars have formed. Thus, the average amount of heavier elements in stars 
varies across different parts of the Galaxy.  Astronomers can use the amount 
of heavy elements in a star to determine what part of the Galaxy the star was 
born in.</p>

<p>Hayden and colleagues used APOGEE data to map the relative amounts of 15 
separate elements, including carbon, silicon, and iron, for stars all over the 
Galaxy.</p>

<p>What they found surprised them &mdash; up to 30 percent of stars had 
compositions indicating that they were formed in parts of the Galaxy far from 
their current positions.</p>

			<p style="color:yellow;">This brief animation shows how stars can 
            change orbits. The animation shows two pairs of stars (marked as red 
            and blue). Within each pair of stars, both start in the same orbit. 
            At random times, one star of the pair changes orbit, moving in our 
            out in our Galaxy. Lines trace the path of each star. Because of the 
            higher density of the inner Galaxy, more stars move in than out.</p>

<p>"While on average the stars in the outer disk of the Milky Way have less 
heavy element enrichment, there is a fraction of stars in the outer disk that 
have heavier element abundances that are more typical of stars in the inner 
disk," says Jo Bovy of the Institute for Advanced Study and the University of 
Toronto, another key member of the research team.</p>

<p>When the team looked at the pattern of element abundances in detail, they found 
that much of the data could be explained by a model in which stars migrate into 
new orbits around the Galactic Center, moving nearer or farther with time. 
These random in-and-out motions are referred to as "migration," and are likely 
caused by irregularities in the Galactic disk, such as the Milky Way's famous 
spiral arms. Evidence of stellar migration had previously been seen in stars 
near the Sun, but the new study is the first clear evidence that migration occurs 
for stars throughout the Galaxy.</p>

<p>Future studies by astronomers using data from SDSS promise even more new 
discoveries. "These latest results take advantage of only a small fraction of 
the available APOGEE data," says Steven Majewski, the Principal Investigator 
of APOGEE. "Once we unlock the full information content of APOGEE, we will 
understand the chemistry and shape of our galaxy much more clearly."</p>
