Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). The top panel shows the targeted blue
quasar, highlighted in the image of the sky, which are thought to be
supermassive black holes in distant galaxies. At the bottom is shown
the BOSS spectrum of the object which allows astronomers to measure
the "redshift," or distance to this object. BOSS plans to collect
millions of such spectra and use their distances to map the geometry
of the Universe. Figure credit: D. Hogg, V. Bhardwaj and N. Ross

<p>The most ambitious attempt yet to trace the history of the universe
has seen "first light." The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(BOSS), a part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), took
its first astronomical data on the night of September 14-15 after
years of preparations.</p>

<p>That night, astronomers used the Sloan Foundation 2.5-meter
telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico to measure the
spectra of a thousand galaxies and quasars, thus starting a quest to
eventually collect spectra for 1.4 million galaxies and 160,000
quasars by 2014.</p>

<p>"The data from BOSS will be the best ever obtained on the large-
scale structure of the universe," said David Schlegel of the U.S.
Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
(Berkeley Lab), the Principal Investigator of BOSS. BOSS uses the
same telescope as the original Sloan Digital Sky Survey, but
equipped with new, specially-built spectrographs to measure the
spectra.</p>

<p>"The new spectrographs are much more efficient in infrared light,"
explained Natalie Roe of Berkeley Lab, the Instrument Scientist for
BOSS. "The light emitted by distant galaxies arrives at Earth as
infrared light, so these improved spectrographs are able to look
much farther back in time."</p>


<p>The ability to look further back in time is important in allowing
BOSS to take advantage of a feature in the universe called "baryon
oscillations." Baryon oscillations began when pressure waves
traveled through the early universe.</p>

<p>"Like sound waves passing through air, the waves push some of the
matter closer together as they travel" said Nikhil Padmanabhan, a
BOSS researcher who recently moved from Berkeley Lab to Yale
University. "In the early universe, these waves were moving at half
the speed of light, but when the universe was only a few hundred
thousand years old, the universe cooled enough to halt the waves,
leaving a signature 500 million light years in length."</p>

<p>"We can see these frozen waves in the distribution of galaxies
today," said Daniel Eisenstein of the University of Arizona, the
Director of the SDSS-III. "By measuring the length of the baryon
oscillations, we can determine how dark energy has affected the
expansion history of the universe. That in turn helps us figure out
what dark energy could be."</p>

<p>"Studying baryon oscillations is an exciting method for measuring
dark energy in a way that's complementary to techniques in supernova
cosmology," said Kyle Dawson of the University of Utah, who is
leading the commissioning of BOSS.  "BOSS's galaxy measurements will
be a revolutionary dataset that will provide rich insights into the
Universe," added Martin White of Berkeley Lab, BOSS's survey
scientist.</p>

<p>BOSS's first data were taken after many nights of clouds and rain.
The first data came from a region of sky in the constellation
Aquarius, causing team member Nic Ross to joke that BOSS first light
marked the "dawning of the Age of Aquarius" after the famous 60's
song by 5th Dimension.  Nic has just joined the Berkeley Lab from
Pennsylvania State University and notes, "Looks like I'm in for a
very hectic, but extremely exciting first month on the job."</p>

<p>The BOSS spectrographs will work with more than two thousand large
metal plates that are placed at the focal plane of the telescope;
these plates are drilled with the precise locations of nearly two
million objects across the northern sky. Optical fibers plugged into
a thousand tiny holes in each of these "plug plates" carry the light
from each observed galaxy or quasar to BOSS's new spectrographs.</p>

<p>Using these plug plates for the first light image should have been
easy, but it didn't quite turn out the way astronomers planned. "In
our first test images, it looked like we'd just taken random spectra
from all over," Schlegel said. After some hair-pulling, the problem
turned out to be simple. "After we flipped the plus and minus signs
in the program, everything worked perfectly."</p>

<p>The first public data release from SDSS-III is planned for December
2010 under the watchful eye of Mike Blanton at the New York
University. "Making high-quality astronomical data available to all
on the Web continues to revolutionize astronomical science and
education, by taking advantage of the talents of not just our team,
but of all astronomers and also the general public." Mike explains
that the original SDSS data has already been used by others in
thousands of research papers.</p>

<p>"This continues the legacy of the SDSS, one of the most productive
astronomical surveys ever undertaken," said Jim Gunn of Princeton
University, who will be awarded this month the National Medal for
Science from President Obama for his pioneering work with the
original SDSS.</p>

<p>"The leadership of this next generation of the SDSS has passed to
the young scientists who did most of the hard work in SDSS I and II,
and they have done a wonderful job, quickly and well. Bravo!"</p>

<h3>About SDSS-III and BOSS</h3>


<p>BOSS is the largest of four surveys in SDSS-III, which includes 350
scientists from 42 institutions.  The BOSS design and implementation
has been led from the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory.  The optical systems were designed and built at
Johns Hopkins University, with new CCD cameras designed and built at
Princeton University and the University of California at Santa Cruz/Lick
Observatory. The University of Washington contributed new optical fiber
systems, and Ohio State University designed and built an upgraded BOSS
data-acquisition system. The "fully depleted" 16-megapixel CCDs for the
red cameras evolved from Berkeley Lab research and were fabricated in
Berkeley Lab's MicroSystems Laboratory (MSL).</p>

<p>Funding for SDSS-III has been provided by the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, the Participating Institutions, the National Science
Foundation, and the U.S. Department of Energy. The SDSS-III web site
is http://www.sdss3.org/.</p>

<p>SDSS-III is managed by the Astrophysical Research Consortium for the
Participating Institutions of the SDSS-III Collaboration, including the
University of Arizona, the Brazilian Participation Group, University
of Cambridge, University of Florida, the French Participation Group,
the German Participation Group, the Michigan State/Notre Dame/JINA
Participation Group, Johns Hopkins University, the U.S. Department of
Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Max Planck Institute
for Astrophysics, New Mexico State University, New York University,
the Ohio State University, University of Portsmouth, Princeton
University, University of Tokyo, the University of Utah, Vanderbilt
University, University of Virginia, University of Washington and Yale
University.</p>
