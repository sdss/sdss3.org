<?php include '../header.php'; echo head('New 3-D Map of Massive Galaxies and Distant Black Holes Offers Clues to Dark Matter and Dark Energy','August 8, 2012'); ?>


<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) has released the largest-ever
three-dimensional map of massive galaxies and distant black holes, which will help
astronomers explain the mysterious "dark matter" and "dark energy" that scientists know
makes up 96 percent of the Universe.</p>

<p>Early last year, the SDSS-III released the largest-ever image of the sky. With the
new release of data, SDSS-III has begun to expand this image into a full
three-dimensional map. <a href="dr9/">Data Release 9</a> (DR9), posted online last
week, makes available the first third of the galaxy map that this six-year
project will create.</p>

"What really makes me proud of this survey is our commitment to
creating a legacy for the future," said Michael Blanton, a professor
at New York University who led the team that prepared DR9.  "Our goal
is to create a map of the Universe that will be used long after we are
done, by future generations of astronomers, physicists and the general
public."
</p>

<p>Data Release 9 is the latest in a series of data releases stretching
back to 2001. This release includes new data from the ongoing SDSS-III
<a href="surveys/boss.php">Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)</a>,
which will eventually measure the positions of 1.5 million massive
galaxies over the past six billion years of cosmic time, as well as
160,000 quasars &mdash; giant black holes actively feeding on stars and
gas &mdash; from as long ago as 12 billion years in the past.</p>

<p>
With such a map, scientists can retrace the history of the Universe over the
last six billion years. With that history, they can get better estimates for
how much of the Universe is made up of dark matter - matter that we can't
directly see because it doesn't emit or absorb light - and dark energy, the
even more mysterious force that drives the accelerating expansion of the Universe.
</p>


<p>
"Dark matter and dark energy are two of the greatest mysteries of our time,"
said David Schlegel of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who led the SDSS-III
effort to map these galaxies and quasars. "We're confident this new map will
guide us, or someone else, in solving these mysteries."

<p>That map of the Universe is the centerpiece of DR9. It includes new spectra from
540,000 galaxies from when the Universe was half its present age. A spectrum is a
measure of light from a galaxy at different wavelengths; from this information we
can measure the distances to those galaxies. This distance information provides
the third dimension in the DR9 map, providing a more detailed view of the
structure of the Universe than has been measured before.</p>


<p>
Quasars provide further details to the three dimensional map and another way
to measure the distribution of matter in the Universe. Quasars are the brightest
objects in the distant Universe, and their spectra reveal intricate patterns
imprinted by the intergalactic gas and underlying dark matter that lies
between each quasar and the Earth.
</p>


<p>The new data in DR9 are not only helping us understand the distant Universe, but
also our own cosmic backyard, the Milky Way galaxy. DR9 includes better estimates
for the chemical compositions of more than half a million stars in our own galaxy.
"With these better estimates, we can look back at the history of our galaxy," said
Connie Rockosi of the  University of California Santa Cruz, who leads the SDSS-
III's Milky Way study. "This new information can help us tell the story of how our
galaxy formed, and how it came to be the Milky Way that we see today."</p>

<p>
All these new images and spectra contain the promise of new discoveries about our Universe -- but the SDSS-III is only in the middle of its six-year survey, and will release three times as much data by the time it's completed in 2014.
</p>


<p>
"The most fun part of making this data available online is knowing that anyone on the Internet can now access the very same data and search tools that professional astronomers use to make exciting discoveries about our Universe," said Ani Thakar of Johns Hopkins University, a key member of the data team who works hard behind-the-scenes to distribute the terabytes of SDSS-III data to astronomers and the public through these data releases.
</p>

<p>
And DR9 doubtless contains many surprises.
</p>

<p>
"This is science at its collaborative best. SDSS-III scientists work together to address big questions extending from our own galaxy to distant reaches of the Universe -- and then they share all of that data with the world to allow anyone to make the next big discovery," said Michael Wood-Vasey, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh and the Scientific Spokesperson for the SDSS-III collaboration.
</p>

<p>
All the data are available now on the <a href="http://www.sdss3.org/dr9">Data Release 9
website</a>. The new data are being made available to astronomers, as well as students, teachers, and the
public. The <a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org">SkyServer website</a>  includes <a href="http://skyserver.sdss3.org/public/en/proj/">lesson plans for teachers</a> that use DR9 data to teach astronomy and other topics in science, technology, and math. DR9 data will also feature in a new release of the <a href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org">Galaxy Zoo</a> citizen science project, which will allow online volunteers to contribute to cutting-edge astronomy research.
