<p>The case of the missing quasar gas clouds has been solved by a worldwide team
of astronomers, and the answer is blowin' in the wind.</p>

<p>Astronomers Nurten Filiz Ak and Niel Brandt of the Pennsylvania State
University led the team, which announced their results in a paper published
in today's issue of <i>The Astrophysical Journal</i>. The paper describes 19
distant quasars in which giant clouds of gas seemed to disappear in just a few years.</p>

<p>"We know that many quasars have structures of fast-moving gas caught up in
'quasar winds,' and now we know that those structures can regularly disappear
from view," says Filiz Ak, a graduate student at Penn State and lead author
of the paper. "But why is this happening?"</p>

<p>
Quasars are powered by gas falling into supermassive black holes at the centers
of galaxies. As the gas falls into the black hole, it heats up and gives off
light. The gravitational force from the black hole is so strong, and is
pulling so much gas, that the hot gas glows brighter than the entire surrounding
galaxy.
</p>


<p>
But with so much going on in such a small space, not all the gas is able to find
its way into the black hole. Much of it instead escapes, carried along by strong
winds blowing out from the center of the quasar.
</p>

<p>
"These winds blow at thousands of miles per second, far faster than any winds
we see on Earth," says Niel Brandt, a professor at Penn State and Filiz Ak's Ph.D.
advisor. "The winds are important because we know that they play an important
role in regulating the quasar's central black hole, as well as star formation
in the surrounding galaxy."

<p>
Many quasars show evidence of these winds in their spectra &mdash; measurements of
the amount of light that the quasar gives off at different wavelengths. Just
outside the center of the quasar are clouds of hot gas flowing away from the
central black hole.  As light from deeper in the quasar passes through these
clouds on its way to Earth, some of the light gets absorbed at particular
wavelengths corresponding to the elements in the clouds.
</p>

<p>
As gas clouds are accelerated to high speeds by the quasar, the Doppler
effect spreads the absorption over a broad range of wavelengths, leading to a
wide valley visible in the spectrum. The width of this "broad absorption line
(BAL)" measures the speed of the quasar's wind. Quasars whose spectra show
such broad absorption lines are known as "BAL quasars."
</p>

<p>
But the hearts of quasars are chaotic, messy places. Quasar winds blow at
thousands of miles per second, and the disk around the central black hole is
rotating at speeds that approach the speed of light. All this adds up to an
environment that can change quickly.
</p>

<p>
Previous studies had found a few examples of quasars whose broad absorption
lines seemed to have disappeared between one observation and the next. But
these quasars had been found one at a time, and largely by chance &mdash; no one
had ever done a systematic search for them. Undertaking such a search would
require measuring spectra for hundreds of quasars, spanning several years.
</p>

<p>
Enter the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Since 1998, SDSS has been regularly
measuring spectra of quasars. Over the past three years, as part of SDSS-III's
Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), the survey has been specifically
seeking out repeated spectra of BAL quasars through a program proposed by Brandt
and colleagues.
</p>

<p>
Their persistence paid off &mdash; the research team gathered a sample
of 582 BAL quasars, each of which had repeat observations over a period of
between one and nine years &ndash; a sample about 20 times larger than any
that had been previously assembled. The team then began to search for changes,
and were quickly rewarded. In 19 of the quasars, the broad absorption lines
had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
What's going on here? There are several possible explanations, but the
simplest is that, in these quasars, gas clouds that we had seen previously
are literally "gone with the wind" &mdash;the rotation of the quasar's disk
and wind have carried the clouds out of the line-of-sight between us and
the quasar.
</p>

<p>
And because the sample of quasars is so large, and had been gathered in such
a systematic manner, the team can go beyond simply identifying disappearing
gas clouds. "We can quantify this phenomenon," says Filiz Ak.
</p>

<p>
Finding nineteen such quasars out of 582 total indicates that about three
percent of quasars show disappearing gas clouds over a three-year span, which
in turn suggests that a typical quasar cloud spends about a century along our
line of sight. "Since the universe is 14 billion years old, we're used to
astronomical phenomena lasting a very long time," says Pat Hall of York
University in Toronto, another team member. "It's fascinating to discover
something that changes within a human lifetime."
</p>

<p>
Now, as other astronomers come up with models of quasar winds, their models
will need to explain this 100-year timescale. As theorists begin to consider
the results, the team continues to analyze their sample of quasars &mdash; more
results are coming soon. "This is really exciting for me," Filiz Ak says.
"I'm sitting at my desk, discovering the nature of the most powerful winds in
the Universe."

		<em>Get spectrum as CSV</em> to get each file. When you open the files, you
		will see four columns of data; the
		first two are the most important. The first column, <span class="term">wavelength</span>,
		is the wavelength of light measured. The wavelength is measured in &Aring;ngstr&ouml;ms
		(1 &Aring; = 10<sup>-10</sup> m). The second column, <span class="term">flux</span>,
		shows how much light the quasar gives off at that wavelength.</p>

		<p>Load the 2002 and 2011 spectra onto the same spreadsheet. Then, make a graph with
		wavelength on the x-axis and flux on the y-axis. Make another graph
		another picture, zooming in on the wavelength region around 4000 &Aring;ngstr&ouml;ms.
