<p>The Milky Way galaxy continues to devour its small neighboring dwarf galaxies
and the evidence is spread out across the sky.</p>

<p>A team of astronomers led by Sergey Koposov and Vasily Belokurov of the University of Cambridge
recently discovered two streams of stars in the Southern Galactic hemisphere
that were torn off the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. This discovery came from analyzing
data from the latest Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) and was announced in a paper
released today (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.7042">arXiv paper #1111.7042</a>) that connects these new streams with two previously known streams in the Northern Galactic hemisphere.</p>

the distances to the stars identified in the study - stars located in red areas are further away,
while stars in the blue areas are closer. The dotted red lines trace out the Sagittarius streams,
and the blue ellipses in the center show the current location of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.

<p>"We have long known that when small dwarf galaxies fall into bigger galaxies,
elongated streams, or tails, of stars are pulled out of the dwarf by the enormous
tidal field," said Sergey Koposov.</p>

<p>The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy used to be one of the brightest of the Milky Way
satellites. Its disrupted remnant now lies on the other side of the Galaxy, breaking
up as it is crushed and stretched by huge tidal forces. It is so small that it has
lost half of its stars and all its gas over the last billion years.</p>

<p>Before SDSS-III, Sagittarius was known to have two tails, one in front of and
one behind the remnant. Previous SDSS imaging had already found the Sagittarius
tidal tail in the Northern Galactic sky in 2006 and revealed that one of the tails
was forked into two.</p>

<p>"That was an amazing discovery," said Vasily Belokurov, "but the remaining piece
  of the puzzle, the structure in the South, was missing until now."</p>

<p>Sergey Koposov and colleagues analyzed density maps of over 13 million
  stars in the latest release of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data,
  including the crucial coverage of the Southern Galactic sky. The new
  data show that the Sagittarius stream in the South is also split into
  two, a fatter and brighter stream alongside a thinner and fainter
  stream.  This brighter stream is more enriched with iron and other
  metals than its dimmer companion.  Because each generation of stars
  makes and distributes more metals into the next generation, the
  Cambridge astronomers concluded that the brighter stream is younger
  than the older fainter one.</p>

<p>"Sagittarius is like a beast with four tails," observed Wyn Evans, from the
Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>No one knows the mechanism that caused the splitting of the tidal tails. However,
scientists believe that perhaps the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy was once a part of a
binary galactic system, similar to the present day Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.
Each of these could have produced a leading and trailing tail on falling into the Milky
Way Galaxy, yielding four in all.</p>

<p>
  But co-author Geraint Lewis of Sydney University has another idea. He says,
  "Perhaps the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy has suffered an encounter with an object in the
  game of Galactic billiards. Maybe a collision with a massive clump of dark matter, or
  even another satellite galaxy, has split each of the streams into two."
</p>


<p>A final theory suggests that, just as meteors have spread into different streams
through evolution in the Solar system, debris from Sagittarius may have spread into
different streams at different points in time. Different epochs may suffer different
amounts of precession in the Galaxy, causing the split streams. "I have been running
hundreds of simulations of the disruption of the Sagittarius dwarf and this idea looks
very plausible," commented Jorge Penarrubia of the IAA, Granada, who was also
involved in the study.</p>

<p>
  Whatever the explanation, SDSS-III has provided a wealth of new information on the
  engorgement of the Sagittarius galaxy. The disruption of smaller galaxies has
  occurred many times in the history of the Milky Way and other galaxies like ours
  throughout the Universe.
</p>

<p>
  The wagging of the four tails of Sagittarius will shed new light on both the structure and formation of the Milky Way.

This YouTube movie shows an illustration of multiple streams produced by the disruption of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in the
Milky Way halo. The orange sphere shows the location of the Sun in the Galaxy. The Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy itself is located in the middle of the stream. The size of the area shown in the movie is
approximately 600 thousands light years (200 kiloparsecs).
