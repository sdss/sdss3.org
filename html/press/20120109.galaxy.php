<p>The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE)
spectrograph is the newest instrument deployed by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey III (SDSS-III).  The revolutionary capabilities of this high-resolution
infrared spectrograph were presented today by Steven Majewski and John Wilson
of the University of Virginia at the 219th meeting of the American Astronomical
Society in Austin, TX.</p>

<p>Over the next three years APOGEE's initial census of the chemical
constitution and motions of more than 100,000 stars spread all over the
Milky Way will bring together data on stars with ages spanning nearly the
full age of the universe, including some of the earliest ever created. These
fossils of earlier times will help astronomers piece together how the Milky Way
grew by devouring smaller galaxies, whose stellar entrails may still be
identified through their particular chemical compositions and motions within
the Galaxy. </p>

<p>In just the first half year of operation, the APOGEE project has observed
with exquisite spectral resolution 32,000 stars throughout the Milky Way &mdash;
more than four times as many stars as have ever previously been observed in
such detail at near-infrared wavelengths by all of the world's telescopes
combined.  Observations in the near infrared are especially critical for
penetrating the veil of dust that obscures most of the stars in our galaxy
from view, while high spectral resolution allows for precise measurements
of the chemical composition and motions of different types of stars
throughout our galaxy.</p>

<p>&quot;APOGEE is enabled by several novel technologies, including a
sophisticated fiber optic system capable of simultaneously channeling the
light of hundreds of individual stars from the telescope, one of the
largest-ever deployed holographic dispersing elements to spread the
light from each star into an infrared rainbow, and a 250-pound (110 kg),
six-element camera with pure silicon lenses 16 inches (400 mm) in diameter
used to record the vast number of stellar rainbows being created at once,&quot;
said Wilson, who led the hardware team in the development of the
state-of-the-art instrument.</p>

<p>By the end of its first three-year general survey of the Milky Way in
mid-2014, SDSS-III scientists will have used the APOGEE spectrograph to
derive precise Doppler motions for stars distributed throughout the Milky Way,
and will, for each of these stars, measure the abundances of fifteen chemical
elements, including carbon, nitrogen and oxygen &mdash; key building-blocks for
life.  One of the biggest advances of APOGEE over previous infrared
spectrographs is its ability to gather these precise data on as many as 300
stars at once.</p>

<p>&quot;The combination of infrared sensitivity and a 300-target multiplexing
capability will make it possible for APOGEE to create the first-ever systematic
and comprehensive probe of stars in every part of our galaxy.  From this census
of our Milky Way we expect many new findings about its structure, dynamics and
constituent stellar populations ... and to do it hundreds of times faster than
would be possible with conventional, one-star-at-a-time instruments,&quot; said
Majewski, the principal investigator for the APOGEE project.</p>

<p>Our galaxy has three major components: the disk, where our Sun lies, a much
larger but more diffusely populated spherical &quot;halo&quot; surrounding the
disk, and a central bulge, densely populated with stars and elongated into a
bar-like shape.  Observing the bulge and much of our Milky Way's disk beyond
the Sun's local neighborhood is challenging because huge swathes of
intervening dust block much of the light at the traditional, visual wavelengths
used for this type of work.  Previous Milky Way surveys (like SEGUE, APOGEE's
sister survey in SDSS-III, which operates at optical wavelengths) have
typically avoided these dustier regions of the Galaxy.</p>

<p>But APOGEE's near-infrared view already is punching through the dust to reveal
previously unseen phenomena in the heart of the Milky Way and beyond &mdash;
to the normally hidden, far-side of the disk.</p>

<p>&quot;This capability has already enabled us to discover a previously
unseen pattern of stellar motions likely influenced by the Milky Way's
central bar,&quot; said David Nidever, who will present some of the first
scientific results from the APOGEE survey at the meeting.  &quot;I can't
wait to dig into the full set of APOGEE data, which will allow us to
determine the properties of the bar and the far side of the Galaxy in
significantly more detail than has been possible before.&quot;</p>

This "first-light" field of stars observed by APOGEE keys in on a large
region in the disk of our galaxy towards the constellation Cygnus
(the Swan, or Northern Cross), which is filled with Milky Way stars, star
clusters and dust (seen as colored, glowing clouds in this image from NASA's
WISE infrared observatory). The large white circle is the field of view of
APOGEE, with a width spanning six moon diameters. The green circles indicate
known or suspected young star clusters. The small red circles indicate the
position of each faint star targeted with APOGEE's fiber optic system. The
inset shows pieces of the APOGEE spectra for stars determined by APOGEE to
be members of two of the clusters shown. These members were identified by
the near identical motions through the galaxy shared by each clusters' stars.
The motions are detected as shifts of the spectral features caused by the
Doppler effect.  These dark line features are caused by absorption of specific
colors of light by the atoms of the different chemical elements in each star.

<p>By spreading the infrared light from stars into infrared rainbows,
APOGEE's spectroscopic observations allow SDSS-III astronomers to sense
stellar motions through the Doppler effect, which shifts a star's spectral
features by an amount corresponding to how quickly the star is moving toward
or away from us.  Because of the high degree with which APOGEE can spread
starlight, the instrument can detect relatively small differences in motion.
With such sensitivity APOGEE astronomers can identify groups of stars having
highly correlated motions, a phenomenon that is often an indication of a
common origin.  Such data make it possible to discriminate stars born and
traveling together in clusters, or that were pulled out of the same star
system cannibalized by the Milky Way.</p>

<p>The APOGEE instrument was assembled at the University of Virginia and
delivered to the Sloan Telescope in New Mexico last April.  Within weeks it
had recorded its &quot;first-light&quot; observations of a field of star
clusters in the direction of the constellation Cygnus (the Swan, or Northern
Cross).  Star clusters are particularly valuable targets for Galactic
astronomers because the distances and ages of these star systems can be
estimated with much greater reliability than those of individual stars.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of star clusters are commingled with the
dust and myriad other, loosely distributed stars in our galaxy's disk.
This mingling makes the clusters not just difficult to study but also a
challenge to identify reliably.  With its first observations, APOGEE proved
that it could not only efficiently identify those stars that are members of
clusters but in addition provide rich amounts of other information about the
motions, chemical compositions, and ages of these star systems.</p>

<p>&quot;These first dozen or so clusters in the 'first-light' field are
just the tip of the iceberg for APOGEE.  The full APOGEE survey will contain
data on many hundreds of clusters, vital tools for exploring the chemical and
dynamical history of our Galaxy,&quot; remarked Peter Frinchaboy
(Texas Christian University), who is demonstrating findings from the
APOGEE &quot;first-light&quot; spectra at the meeting.</p>

<p>Because each chemical element or molecule absorbs a characteristic set of
wavelengths of light, the lines observed in a stellar spectrum reveal the
chemical composition of a star.  Some of the most anticipated results from
APOGEE will come from exploring how the chemical compositions of stars change
with their ages and locations in the Galaxy.  These variations in composition
come about because stars use nuclear fusion in their cores to join lighter
atoms into heavier atoms.  In the process of living and dying, some stars
deposit those heavier atoms back into the interstellar gas clouds used to
create subsequent generations of stars in the Galaxy.  APOGEE's huge chemical
database on so many stars will yield vital clues to how our galaxy formed in
an early universe of primarily hydrogen and helium and subsequently evolved
through many generations of stars to its present level of heavy element
enrichment &mdash; a level sufficient to allow solar systems like our own to
form with all of the necessary ingredients to produce Earth-like planets and,
ultimately, life.</p>
