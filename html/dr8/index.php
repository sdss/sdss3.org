<?php include '../header.php'; echo head('The Eighth SDSS Data Release (DR8)'); ?>

<p>Following the successful practice established by SDSS-I and
SDSS-II, SDSS-III will publicly release its raw and reduced data.
The Eighth Data Release (DR8), following the Early Data Release
and Data Releases 1-7 of SDSS-I/II is now available as of January 2011.
The release contains all of the imaging data taken by
the SDSS imaging camera (now totalling over 14,000 square degrees of
sky), as well as new spectra taken by the SDSS spectrograph during its
last year of operations for the SEGUE-2 project.
All of the imaging data have been re-reduced using improved data
processing pipelines.</p>

<p>The items in the menubar above contain the following
information about DR8:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="dr8/scope.php">Scope</a> of the release
    provides information on the
    solid angle of the imaging data; the number of imaging
    objects in the SDSS-III Catalog Archive Server (CAS),
    and so on. </li>
  <li>The <a href="dr8/data_access.php">Data Access</a> page explains how
    to access the data.</li>
  <li>The <a href="dr8/imaging/">Imaging data</a> page explains
    exactly what imaging
    data are released and provides details
    on the imaging pipeline, the calibration process, the units of the
    quantities in the catalogs, and so on.</li>
  <li>The <a href="dr8/spectro/">Spectroscopic data</a> page
    explains exactly what
    spectroscopic data are available and provides details on
    target masks, redshifts, classifications, and so on.</li>
  <li>The <a href="dr8/software/">Software</a> page provides some
    software documentation and download instructions.</li>
  <li>The <a href="dr8/algorithms/">Algorithms</a> page lists
  some of the principal SDSS-III data processing algorithms.</li>
  <li> The <a href="dr8/glossary.php">Glossary</a> lists technical
  terms associated with the SDSS.</li>
  <li>The <a href="dr8/help/">Help</a> page is a
    starting point for new users.
    It contains tutorials, FAQ's, and other documentation
    to help one get started.</li>
  <li>The <a href="dr8/whatsnew.php">What's new?</a> page
    explains the differences between DR7 and DR8. </li>
