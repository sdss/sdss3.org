<h2>Comparison of [Fe/H] of cluster members between DR8 SSPP and literature</h2>

<p>The following figure shows how well the
overall metallicity from the DR8 SSPP agrees with the literature,
without any significant trend along g-r or S/N from very metal-poor
cluster (M92 or M15) to very metal-rich open cluster (NGC 6791). This
proves the very reliable estimate of [Fe/H] from the DR8 SSPP. The
solid line delineates the literature value and ours for the
dashed line.</p>
